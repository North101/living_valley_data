By changing from one form to another, the spirit sets the stage, introduces the players, and then tells his tale. While an imperfect storytelling method, you find yourself understanding more than you do not. It seems clear to you now that the spirit is doing this for your benefit. It seems truly energized to once again have an audience. You wonder if you bring the spirit to the Cage, perhaps he will tell you a story that reveals something vital about its construction."
