But the interesting element is just how important the Estians considered the Arboretum of Memory. It served as the data archives for the entirety of Vista while also storing so much information from the ancient world. Although the sheer amount of information makes searching for specifics problematic, you know that you hold the entire history of the Estians in your hands."
