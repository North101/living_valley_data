The first section contains a series of logs detailing spindlescuttler excavation efforts and describing how these have proven much more useful than other methods. Ral caustically notes that the success of the spindlescuttlers has finally shut down attempts to dig the caverns using \u201cquark waveform detonations\u201d and their \u201conly .1% chance of unleashing a cascading collapse that would destroy all of Colorado.\u201d"

The spindlescuttlers were essential to dig out the arcology, even as a massive reservoir was excavated just beyond the Bitter Pass, at the head of the Silverfin, to capture the excessive rain and prevent the Valley from flooding. A hydroelectric dam was then constructed to supply the arcology with power."

There are also entries referring to arguments between the supporters of each, and some strong arguments about the dangers of the Arbol Initiative."

Your blood runs cold as you imagine the implacable wall of water rushing toward the arcology, destroying everything in its path. There would have been no escape."
