It also has a series of briefings on the purpose of the massive stairway and the Chimney\u2019s vast, plaza-like chamber floor. Unsurprisingly, both the stairway and the chamber floor are described as the most important thoroughfares connecting the arcology\u2019s upper levels to one another. The Chimney is also the main access point to the outside of the arcology, although the blueprints show some other secondary access points scattered across the Valley."
