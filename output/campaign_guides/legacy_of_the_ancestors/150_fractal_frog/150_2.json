Its already huge eyes widen further in shock. Apparently, you startled it. But instead of hopping away, it shakes as though gripped by an unseen hand and splits in two! Before your eyes, a whole new frog grows out of the first one and quickly hops away. The other frog sits there, blinking lazily, then gurgles again."
