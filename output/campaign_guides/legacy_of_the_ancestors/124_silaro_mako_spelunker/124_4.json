Hm, if the remains in that inverted forest are the scout Xavi, the presence in the mycelial network must be Yara. I guess she learned far more about those mushrooms than she expected. The cloak you spotted in the scuttlebus\u2019s teeth is probably Hollan herself. That means the survivor is Timo. It seems that he preferred the company of the machines and ruins to that of people on the surface. Can't say there aren't days I feel similarly, but I don't know if I'd take it to that extreme!\u201d"
