Knowing Silaro, that isn\u2019t so remarkable, but then you notice that the book is not one of Silaro's own scrolls or journals. Judging by the weathered and beaten cover, you figure that it must be some kind of relic recovered from the ruins. Whatever the book\u2019s origin, Silaro is clearly absorbed by its contents. He takes no notice of you as he turns the page, thoughtfully mumbling to himself."
