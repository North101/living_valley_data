Silaro\u2019s team has rigged up heavy lambance rigs that illuminate the entire space in a warm, golden glow that reminds you of the sunrise over Blind Peak. Even as it dispels the ominous aura that once filled the space, the light lets you appreciate its true grandeur. From distant walls, the roof rises in graceful, bounding arches. Far above, they meet at a cluster of strange spherical structures from which the Chimney descends."
