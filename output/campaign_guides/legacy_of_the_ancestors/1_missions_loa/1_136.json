You extend a word of cautious greeting, and are thrilled when you hear an echoing greeting return! The voices are muddled and many are speaking a language you don\u2019t understand, but you can sense some of the personalities behind them. Some of the words resemble the bits of the Estian tongue that Silaro shared with you, and you start to suspect that this network was used to preserve the thoughts of the Estians. You\u2019re not sure if this was done on purpose, or if the fungal network grew into the bodies of some unfortunate Estians and absorbed their intellect.\nThen you hear a voice that speaks in your own tongue. \u201cHello?\u201d it says. \u201cAre you there? Who are you?\u201d"
