You find that if you remain still, and listen beyond the sound of dripping water\u2014and that of your own heartbeat\u2014you can perceive a distant thrum coming from somewhere above, reverberating through the surrounding rock. The rhythm of the thrum syncs with the occasional release of water into the chamber from the openings above, followed shortly thereafter by a low gurgling sound as that water is flushed from the chamber. You reflect on how great is the generosity of the Estians that they should leave so many mechanical wonders to be discovered and utilized by a people they would never meet in waking life."

You\u2019re surprised then to learn that the Carbon Forge he discovered was but one of many\u2014part of a vast workshop in which much of what the Estians wrought was brought to life and subsequently abandoned. However, these other forges are clearly in a state of horrible disrepair, perhaps beyond salvaging. You also find several depowered and disassembled machines, some as small as your closed fist, but others the size of a stilt horse. You\u2019re guessing the Estians used these machines extensively in constructing and maintaining the arcology, and there are probably more workshops and maintenance bays deeper within."
