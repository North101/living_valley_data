You're surpised to find that it appears to be fully functional, and unlike its counterpart, it beats at a steady rhythm."

The Estians designed the entire arcology as a single living organism, and this device was grown to be its literal heart, but also its mind. You shake your head as you grapple with the immense skill and towering ambition of the Estians. To create such a thing -- to give it life, and then live within it -- no idea could sound less appealing to any who live under the open sky."

It's clear from what you've observed of the prototype that it beats in response to electric pulses sent to it from the regulator. You wonder if perhaps delivering an electric shock to the heart might cause the system to reset, and return its rhythm to normal."
