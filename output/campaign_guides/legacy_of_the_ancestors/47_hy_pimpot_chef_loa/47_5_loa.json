He sets a pot upon a single Sol coil and fills it with water sprinkled with herbs. Soon the broth is boiling, and he adds the mushrooms, each type, at seemingly predetermined moments. After what feels like an eternity, the stew is ready. It smells both earthy and delicious. As you go to take a bite, Hy clears his throat. \u201cJust to warn you,\u201d he says. \u201cThese mushrooms are not for the faint of heart. I\u2019d be willing to bet that they might have something of a \u2026 mind expanding effect.\u201d"

You look down, and you see the Valley and the arcology as it must have been thousands of years ago. The Fractured Wall is whole again, with a vast lake behind it. In place of Spire is a glimmering structure, glowing blue-white with the energies flowing to it from the Concordant Ziggurats. And, beneath the surface, you can somehow feel the many tunnels stretching out to all corners of the Valley, and far below them, a beating heart."
