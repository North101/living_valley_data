He smiles. \u201cWell, I have to admit that ever since Silaro started going on about his great expedition into the arcology, it\u2019s gotten me thinking about all the mushrooms that must be down there. The fungi you can find up here in the Valley are just fine, of course, but just think of all the different species you could find down in those tunnels! Why, I bet I could make a stew entirely out of mushrooms, and it would be the best thing you\u2019ve ever tasted!\u201d"
