Then you\u2019re standing just behind the cascade, buffeted by gusts of cold, spray-soaked wind, and you feel the impulses flowing through you change. Instead of protecting it, the seed now wants you to \u2026 throw it away?"

You think that perhaps you\u2019ve gained something in your time with this strange plant."
