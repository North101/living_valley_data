Drawn by a morbid curiosity, you move closer, fascinated by the tiny, subterranean crustations. You\u2019ve heard tell of such beings from the Messipian, Ren Kobo, but have never seen one for yourself. Suddenly, you hear splashes and the sound of breaking branches behind you. You spin around to see a pair of reclaimers clambering over the tangled mass toward you!"
