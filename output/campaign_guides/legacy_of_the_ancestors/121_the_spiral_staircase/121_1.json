In the light, you can appreciate the cunning design that went into the Spiral Stairway\u2019s construction. Instead of a perfectly symmetrical stairway, the structure twists and winds like a tree. As it rises, additional stairways branch off from the central structure and rise up into the Chimney, leading off into side passages and chambers."
