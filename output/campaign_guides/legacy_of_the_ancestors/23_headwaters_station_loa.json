              "text": "The current strengthens as the river narrows, flowing swiftly from a claustrophobic canyon up ahead. Your boat bucks against the fast-moving water, but you finally make it past the mouth of the canyon and find a rope rigged along the rock wall, perfect for pulling yourself along. After long minutes of hauling, the canyon widens and you pull yourself into a circular basin. Several small waterfalls form a droning chorus, drowning out all other sound as they feed the sapphire-blue pool."
