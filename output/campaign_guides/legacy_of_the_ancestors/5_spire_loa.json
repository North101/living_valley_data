A massive gray spire at the center of the island towers over the cottages, workshops, and trade halls that make up the rest of the town. As impressive as it is, you know that it is but a protrusion of the ancient arcology that extends deep into the roots of the Valley. The entrance to that arcology lies beyond the Arcology Threshold."

In just two months, much of the damage from the reclaimer attack has already been repaired."
