              "text": "The current strengthens as the river narrows, flowing swiftly from a\nclaustrophobic canyon up ahead. Your boat bucks against the swiftmoving\nwater, but you finally make it past the mouth of the canyon, and\nfind a rope rigged along the rock wall, perfect for pulling yourself along.\nAfter long minutes of hauling, the canyon widens and you pull yourself\ninto a circular basin. Several small waterfalls form a droning chorus,\ndrowning out all other sound as they feed the sapphire-blue pool."
