Above the pedestal, you see a whirling rainbow mass of\nsparkling shards of glass. Even as you watch, Tollin reaches into the\nbag\u2014while wearing a heavy glove\u2014and hauls out another handful of\nshards, carefully casting them into the air. You see the brief flash of\nan otherwise invisible suspensor field, and the shards join the larger\ncloud. Tollin thinks for a moment, then uses a pole to nudge and push\nthe material into a new form. You\u2019ve heard of kinetic glass before, but\nthis is the first time you\u2019ve seen it used in such a quantity."
