During your training, on clear,\nwindless days, these platforms served as a refuge. You would often\nspend your free time in the afternoons bathing there in the sun, sitting\nin quiet contemplation and looking out over the mirrored surface of\nWhite Sky Lake. You'd also look wistfully at the airship known as the\nSwift, it's hull gleaming in the sun, as Ben Amon would climb aboard\nand launch it into the air."
