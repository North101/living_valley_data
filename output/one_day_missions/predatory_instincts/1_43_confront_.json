The caustic mulcher seems to respond favorably to firm pressure on whatever part of its anatomy lies underneath the fleshy mass currently clutched in your arms. You begin a careful process of trial and error, massaging around the \"thorax\" until the mulcher begins to emit a horrific gurgling sound. Emitted from any other being, you'd assume the sound indicated an upset stomach or some other ailment, but coming from the mulcher, you're  certain its a sound akin to the joyous purring of a lutrinal. Perhaps with enough time and patience, you may just be able to tame it, but for now, you feel like you can at least lead it away from Spire and into the heart of the forest."
