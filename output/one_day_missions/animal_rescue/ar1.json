She clears space off of one of the counters in her lab and together, very carefully, you lay the animal down on its side. \u201cWe don\u2019t usually do rehabilitation like this, but since you came all this way, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m releasing it into the wild in this condition. Please wash your hands and come with me\u2014I\u2019ll need your assistance.\u201d"
