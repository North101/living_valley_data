Finally, she brings the sleeping fawn to an empty cage and places her gently on the cushioned bed inside.  \"I'll keep an eye on her as she recovers. She should make a full recovery. We'll have to keep her here until she's grown a little more, but we should be able to release her back into the wild after that.\" She gives you a warm smile and shakes your hand. \"You've done her a great service today. I don't doubt she'll never forget what you've done for her.\"</p></blockquote><p><b>If the wounded animal was a lutrinal:</b></p><blockquote id=\"narration_2\"><p>Sirisana administers a tranquilizer to the lutrinal, putting him to sleep, then gets to work setting the bone while you hold him steady.
