You've tried your best, but it doesn't seem likely that you'll be able to reach the Biological Outpost in time to help your new friend. You set out some medical supplies and get to work patching yourself up first. Hopefully you can make camp for the night, treat the animal's injuries and your own as best you can, and resume in the morning. If you're lucky, it'll last the night.</p></blockquote><p><b>Another human cleared with <icon icon=\"harm\">&nbsp;</icon>:</b></p><blockquote id=\"narration_3\"><p>With one of the Valley's residents in immediate danger, you have no choice but to stop and administer first aid.  Seems you have two charges to protect now, but your responsibility is first and foremost to the humans of the Valley. You send up a starspark that soars high into the air and explodes with light. You're going to need help if you are to care for both of them at the same time. </p></blockquote><h1 id=\"eod2\">EoD2</h1><p><b>Ranger too fatigued:</b></p><blockquote id=\"narration_4\"><p>\"Take a break,\" Sirisana says as you wipe sweat from your brow. \"You came so far to get here\u2014let me take it from here.\" You sit and take a breather, hoping she can handle the treatment on her own. </p></blockquote><p><b>Ranger too injured:</b></p><blockquote id=\"narration_5\"><p>\"You're in bad shape,\" Sirisana says, looking over your wounds. \"Here, lie down.

Your responsibility is first and foremost to the humans of the Valley, after all. Thankfully, the medical supplies in the Biological Outpost should do the trick, but it'll take some time. You can only hope your animal friend holds out in the meantime.</p></blockquote>",
