You\u2019ve tried your best, but it doesn\u2019t seem likely that you\u2019ll be able to reach the Biological Outpost in time to help your new friend. You set out some medical supplies and get to work patching yourself up first. Hopefully you can make camp for the night, treat the animal\u2019s injuries and your own as best you can, and resume in the morning. If you\u2019re lucky, it\u2019ll last the night.</p></blockquote><p><b>Another human cleared with <icon icon=\"harm\">&nbsp;</icon>:</b></p><blockquote><p>With one of the Valley\u2019s residents in immediate danger, you have no choice but to stop and administer first aid.  Seems you have two charges to protect now, but your responsibility is first and foremost to the humans of the Valley. You send up a starspark that soars high into the air and explodes with light. You\u2019re going to need help if you are to care for both of them at the same time. </p></blockquote><h1 id=\"eod2\">EoD2</h1><branch id=\"resolve-the-following-based-on-how-you-ended-the-day-1\">RESOLVE THE FOLLOWING BASED ON HOW YOU ENDED THE DAY:</branch><p><b>Ranger too fatigued:</b></p><blockquote><p>\u201cTake a break,\u201d Sirisana says as you wipe sweat from your brow. \u201cYou came so far to get here\u2014let me take it from here.\u201d You sit and take a breather, hoping she can handle the treatment on her own. </p></blockquote><p><b>Ranger too injured:</b></p><blockquote><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in bad shape,\u201d Sirisana says, looking over your wounds. \u201cHere, lie down.
