You check the fawn's legs for injuries, but they seem uninjured. You wonder if its hoof is cracked or wounded in some way. Calming it down enough to lift its leg, you examine the hoof. Indeed, the hoof has cracked and a piece has torn off, likely during a scuffle or chase through the rough woodlands. This doe definitely won\u2019t survive on its own\u2014even a lone wolhund would pounce on such easy prey without hesitation. With no other pressing tasks on hand, you take it upon yourself to try to help this young doe. If you can bring her to the Biological Outpost, maybe Sirisana Mir or one of the other researchers there can repair the cracked hoof and restore her to health.</p></blockquote><p>Put the <b>Ancestor's Grove</b> location card into play in the surroundings.</p><p>Create the path deck by shuffling together the Woods set and 3 random cards from the Valley set.

Thankfully it hasn\u2019t broken the skin, but you know this poor guy isn\u2019t going to last without help. The fracture is far too severe to heal on its own. At the very best, he\u2019ll be left behind by the rest of his romp. At worst, he\u2019ll succumb to pain or get caught by a hungry Naiad.
