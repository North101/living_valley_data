You look up to see another Ranger by the name of Kal Iver standing beside none other than Ren Kobo. \"You can call off the hunt,\" says Kal. \"Ren Kobo has been found.

Then, you hear the sound of voices from up the trail. You call out, and are soon greeted by the sight of a small party of Rangers accompanied by none other than the Messipian merchant, Ren Kobo.</p><p>As they approach, Ren Kobo reaches into his cloak. \"Let me see if I have something for those wounds of yours!\" he says.
