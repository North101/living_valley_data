You sit beneath the shelter of a tall, sturdy oak and drift off to sleep.</p><p>Some hours later a light kick against your boot rouses you from your slumber. You look up to see another Ranger by the name of Kal Iver standing beside none other than Ren Kobo. \"You can call off the hunt,\" says Kal. \"Ren Kobo has been found. Next time, I recommend you keep your eyes open. It helps with the searching!\"</p><p>Ren Kobo tips his hat toward you as he and Kal Iver continue down the trail.</p></blockquote><p><b>Ranger too injured:</b></p><blockquote id=\"narration_2\"><p>You wince as you try to walk. Leaning against a tree, you stifle a moan. You've tried your best, but you can't continue the search for Ren Kobo in this state. You decide to rest and treat your injuries.</p><p>After drinking an invigorating tea and wrapping your wounds in blue kelpweed, you begin to feel much better. Then, you hear the sound of voices from up the trail. You call out, and are soon greeted by the sight of a small party of Rangers accompanied by none other than the Messipian merchant, Ren Kobo.</p><p>As they approach, Ren Kobo reaches into his cloak. \"Let me see if I have something for those wounds of yours!\" he says. You sigh at the irony, but are glad for the help.</p></blockquote><p><b>Another human cleared with <icon icon=\"harm\">&nbsp;</icon>:</b></p><blockquote id=\"narration_3\"><p>With someone else in more immediate need, the search for Ren Kobo will have to wait. You send up a starspark, signaling for any Ranger in the vicinity to come to your aid. It soars high above the trees and explodes in a shower of glittering white light. You assure your companion that help is on the way. </p></blockquote><h1 id=\"eod2\">EoD2</h1><p><b>Ranger too fatigued:</b></p><blockquote id=\"narration_4\"><p>Your legs burn as you put one foot in front of the other, but at a certain point you know you just can't go on. You flop down against a large, moss-covered rock. Ren Kobo slides down the rock next to you, panting.</p><p>\"We've come a long way, but I can see it in your face that we're not making it any further today.\" The old Messipian gives you a compassionate smile. \"The good news is that I think that giant raptor only hunts during the day! We should be safe to set up camp.\"</p><p>Ren Kobo takes hold of your arm, and leaning on each other for support, you and he stand, then begin to make camp. You didn't quite make it to the Ranger Station, but at least you know that Ren Kobo is safe.</p></blockquote><p><b>Ranger too injured:</b></p><blockquote id=\"narration_5\"><p>You wince as you try to walk. Leaning against a tree, you stifle a moan. You've tried your best, but you aren't going to be able to travel far until you take a long rest.</p><p>Ren Kobo puts your arm over his shoulder and heaves you to your feet. \"We aren't done yet!\" he says.</p><p>With a strength you didn't know the merchant possessed, he supports your weight as you continue down the trail. It looks like you won't be the one doing the rescuing today after all.</p></blockquote><p><b>Another human cleared with <icon icon=\"harm\">&nbsp;</icon>:</b></p><blockquote id=\"narration_6\"><p>Ren Kobo runs over to your injured companion. \"Don't you worry!\" he says. \"I never leave the flotilla without an emergency medical kit!\" He draws a leather satchel from beneath his cloak, opens it, and sets to work.</p><p>You send up a starspark, signaling for any Ranger in the vicinity to come to your aid. It soars high above the trees and explodes in a shower of glittering white light. You tell companions that help is on the way.</p></blockquote>",
