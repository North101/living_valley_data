When you perform a test on a card in your <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/player_area\">player area</a> or on a played card, if that test directly affects a card <a href=\"rules_glossary/i/in_play\">in play</a>, you count as interacting with the affected card or cards. For example, the Traverse test can place <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/progress\">progress</a> on the <a href=\"rules_glossary/l/locations\">location</a>. When you perform that test, you count as interacting with the location.</p><p>When you interact with the environment, things between you and the thing with which you\u2019re interacting may cause you to suffer <a href=\"rules_glossary/f/fatigue\">fatigue</a>. This might be a feisty Lutrinal harrying you as you try to accomplish your task, or some difficult terrain slowing you down.</p><p>Before you perform a test, each <a href=\"rules_glossary/r/ready\">ready</a> card between you and the farthest card with which you are interacting <a href=\"rules_glossary/f/fatigue\">Fatigues</a> you. Which ready cards are between you and that card depends on the <a href=\"rules_glossary/a/area\">area</a>  in which it sits:</p><ul><li><b>Card is <a href=\"rules_glossary/w/within_reach\">within reach</a>:</b> Only cards <a href=\"rules_glossary/a/attach\">attached</a>  to your <a href=\"rules_glossary/r/role\">role</a> are between you.</li><li><b>Card is <a href=\"rules_glossary/w/within_reach\">within reach</a> of another Ranger:</b> All cards within reach of you and <a href=\"rules_glossary/a/attach\">attached</a>  to your <a href=\"rules_glossary/r/role\">role</a> are between you.</li><li><b>Card is <a href=\"rules_glossary/a/along_the_way\">along the way</a> :</b> All cards within reach of you and <a href=\"rules_glossary/a/attach\">attached</a>  to your <a href=\"rules_glossary/r/role\">role</a> are between you.</li><li><b>Card is in the <a href=\"rules_glossary/s/surroundings\">surroundings</a>:</b> All cards within reach of you, <a href=\"rules_glossary/a/along_the_way\">along the way</a> , and <a href=\"rules_glossary/a/attach\">attached</a>  to your <a href=\"rules_glossary/r/role\">role</a> are between you.</li></ul><p>Some <a href=\"rules_glossary/r/ranger_cards\">Ranger cards</a> and game effects will act upon a card and manipulate it in some way without performing a <a href=\"rules_glossary/t/tests\">test</a>. These effects are not considered interactions, so cards between you and the affected card do not fatigue you.</p><p>If a test on a card in your player area or on a played card interacts with multiple cards, only resolve this step once for the card with which you\u2019re interacting that is furthest from you.</p><ul><li>Each card that <a href=\"rules_glossary/f/fatigue\">fatigues</a> you when interacting does so separately. So effects that trigger \"when you suffer fatigue\" (for example Thoroughly Prepared), must choose one of these instances of fatigue to affect.</li></ul>",
