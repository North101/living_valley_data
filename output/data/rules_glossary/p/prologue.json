This is a guided game session that will gradually introduce concepts of the game and walk everyone through building their Ranger decks as they play. You can play through the Prologue by going to page 2 of the <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_guide\">campaign guide</a>  and following the instructions there. You will not need to do any prep ahead of playing the Prologue (other than reading the rules).</p>",
