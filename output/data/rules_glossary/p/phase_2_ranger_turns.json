This is where you\u2019ll be equipping your gear, interacting with the environment around you, and using your abilities to accomplish your goals for the day.</p><p>During this phase, each Ranger takes separate turns. There is no limit to the number of turns a Ranger can take each <a href=\"rules_glossary/r/round\">round</a>. You decide as a group which Ranger takes the first turn, and following that, Rangers can take their turns in any order. Unless you are the only Ranger still taking turns, a different Ranger must go after you finish your turn. You can take a second turn in a row by <a href=\"rules_glossary/e/exhaust\">exhausting</a> your <a href=\"rules_glossary/r/role\">role</a> card.</p><p>On your <a href=\"rules_glossary/t/turns\">turn</a>, you can do one of the following:</p><ul><li>Perform a <a href=\"rules_glossary/t/tests\">Test</a></li><li><a href=\"rules_glossary/p/play\">Play</a> a <a href=\"rules_glossary/r/ranger_cards\">Ranger Card</a></li><li>Rest</li></ul><p>At the beginning or end of  any Ranger\u2019s turn, you can resolve any exhaust abilities that don't specify a <a href=\"rules_glossary/t/timing\">timing</a>, or any other abilities that can be triggered by you that don't have a specified timing (such as the discard effect on Dayhowler). At this time you can also discard any equipped gear you no longer want.</p>",
