As you play, you might ask yourself, \u201cWhat would my Ranger do in this situation?\u201d This may be different than what you might do if you were in that situation. Making decisions based on your Ranger\u2019s personality can be a lot of fun if you enjoy roleplaying.</p><p>Each card in the personality <a href=\"rules_glossary/s/sets\">set</a> is an attribute, which means they can only be <a href=\"rules_glossary/d/discard\">discarded</a> for their <a href=\"rules_glossary/a/approach_icons\">approach icons</a>  during <a href=\"rules_glossary/t/tests\">tests</a>. You can use personality cards to help balance out the mix of approach icons in your deck, but you can just as easily use them to make your Ranger even better at the things they\u2019re already good at.</p><p>If you\u2019d like to lean into the roleplaying opportunities of the game, you can choose your personality cards based purely on theme. Choosing a card simply because you like the title, or because you like the accompanying narrative text, is a totally valid approach.</p>",
