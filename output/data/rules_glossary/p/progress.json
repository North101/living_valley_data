It is a measure of time spent. For example, progress placed on a feature or a <a href=\"rules_glossary/l/locations\">location</a> may represent time spent walking across it, exploring it, or simply contemplating its beauty. Similarly, progress placed on <a href=\"rules_glossary/b/beings\">beings</a>  may represent time spent conversing with that being, studying its behavior, or convincing it to let you pass unharmed. You clear a card with progress when the amount of progress equals or exceeds its <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/progress_threshold\">progress threshold</a>. This simply means that you've spent sufficient time with it to enjoy any benefits it might provide or to safely proceed beyond its presence.</p>",
