  "content": "<p>Traveling is how you move around the Valley, visit new locations, discover people and places unique to certain areas.</p><p>You can choose travel during <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/phase_3_travel\">Phase 3: Travel</a> if the number of <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/progress\">progress</a> tokens on the <a href=\"rules_glossary/l/locations\">location</a> equal or exceed its <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/progress_threshold\">progress threshold</a>, or components such as the <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_guide\">campaign guide</a>  or <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/path_cards\">path cards</a> can instruct you to travel immediately.</p><p>When you travel, perform the following steps:</p><h1 id=\"1-clear-play-area\">1. Clear Play Area</h1><p><a href=\"rules_glossary/d/discard\">Discard</a> all <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/path_cards\">path cards</a> <a href=\"rules_glossary/i/in_play\">in play</a> and all <a href=\"rules_glossary/r/ranger_cards\">Ranger cards</a> <a href=\"rules_glossary/w/within_reach\">within reach</a>, <a href=\"rules_glossary/a/along_the_way\">along the way</a> , or in the <a href=\"rules_glossary/s/surroundings\">surroundings</a> (but not in your <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/player_area\">player area</a>). Then sort all cards from the path deck and path discard into their <a href=\"rules_glossary/s/sets\">sets</a>, and return them to your <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/the_collection\">collection</a> .</p><p><i>Note: Cards with the <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/persistent_keyword\">persistent</a> <a href=\"rules_glossary/k/keywords\">keyword</a> are not discarded.</i></p><p><a href=\"rules_glossary/m/missions\">Missions</a> that instruct you to \u201ctravel away\u201d from a location resolve at this time.\u00a0</p><h1 id=\"2-travel-to-a-new-location\">2. Travel to a new location</h1><p>As a group, choose a new <a href=\"rules_glossary/l/locations\">location</a> to travel to by consulting the <a href=\"rules_glossary/v/the_valley_map\">Valley map</a> You must choose a <a href=\"rules_glossary/n/nearby\">nearby</a> location - one that is connected directly to your current location by one of the paths marked on the map. The chosen destination must be the next location on the chosen path (you cannot \u201cskip\u201d over a location).</p><p>Once the group has chosen a destination, find its location card, and place it into the <a href=\"rules_glossary/s/surroundings\">surroundings</a>, replacing the current location.</p><p><i>Note: You cannot travel along river paths until a certain game component allows you to do so.</i></p><h1 id=\"3-decide-to-camp\">3. Decide to Camp</h1><p>After choosing your new <a href=\"rules_glossary/l/locations\">location</a>, as a group, you can decide to <a href=\"rules_glossary/e/end_the_day\">end the day</a> and set up camp for the night before venturing into the new landscape. Ending the day in this way is safer than ending it in the middle of navigating through a location and allows you an opportunity to prepare yourselves for the next day.</p><p>If you end the day in this way, you are allowed to swap reward cards into your Ranger decks between sessions (see <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/customizing_ranger_decks\">customizing ranger decks</a>). If you chose not to end the day, continue to step 4.</p><h1 id=\"4-build-the-path-deck\">4. Build the Path Deck</h1><p>To build the path deck for your new location, combine several sets of path cards:</p><ul><li><b>Terrain Set:</b> The <a href=\"rules_glossary/l/locations\">locations</a> in the Valley can be vast areas, and the path you take can dramatically change your experience of them. The terrain you travel across determines what kinds of features and wildlife you will encounter.<br>Each path on the <a href=\"rules_glossary/v/the_valley_map\">Valley map</a> has an associated type of terrain based on its color and an icon that appears along the line. To form the base of the path deck, find all path cards from the <a href=\"rules_glossary/s/sets\">set</a> matching the type of terrain of the path you took to the new location.</li><li><b>Location Set:</b> Certain <a href=\"rules_glossary/l/locations\">locations</a> have notable people and places to seek out or discover on your journey. These locations are pivotal. This is listed on their card and is marked on the <a href=\"rules_glossary/v/the_valley_map\">Valley map</a> with a gold and brown eight-pointed star. These locations have sets of <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/path_cards\">path cards</a> unique to them. Add each of these cards to the path deck.<br>If your new location is not pivotal, you are never quite sure who or what you\u2019ll encounter. You might find one of the Valley\u2019s other wanderers, other features of the Valley, or an exceptionally dangerous predator. Shuffle all the path cards in The Valley <a href=\"rules_glossary/s/sets\">set</a>, and add three random cards from this set to the path deck.</li><li><b>Other Path Cards:</b> Other game effects may add additional cards to the path deck. Check the <a href=\"rules_glossary/w/weather\">weather</a>, <a href=\"rules_glossary/l/locations\">location</a>, and <a href=\"rules_glossary/m/missions\">missions</a> for any instructions labeled \u201cPath Deck Assembly.\u201d When you finish building the path deck, shuffle it.</li></ul><h1 id=\"5-arrival-setup\">5. Arrival Setup</h1><p>Read the <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_guide\">campaign guide</a>  entry noted on the back of the location card.</p><p><a href=\"rules_glossary/m/missions\">Missions</a> to \u201carrive at\u201d a location resolve now. These may override reading the normal <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_guide\">campaign guide</a>  entry.</p><p>To finish setting up your destination, resolve each instruction under the \u201cArrival Setup\u201d header. Most cards instruct the lead Ranger to resolve an effect then have some number of \u201cnext Rangers\u201d resolve effects. If an effect calls for the \u201cnext Ranger,\u201d but each Ranger has already resolved an effect, ignore those additional effects.</p><h1 id=\"travel-flowchart\">Travel Flowchart</h1><img src=\"https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/assets/images/Flow_Charts4-07d90ea2f463f11040421b185e3545c5.png\">",
