Any effects that don\u2019t specify a timing are either ongoing effects that are always in effect, or effects that you can choose to use during any Ranger\u2019s <a href=\"rules_glossary/t/turns\">turn</a>.</p><p>Effects that specify a timing will do so relative to a step in the rules (or sometimes another game effect) using one of the following words:</p><p><b>Before:</b> The effect <a href=\"rules_glossary/r/resolve\">resolves</a> immediately before you begin the specified step.\u00a0</p><p><b>When:</b> The effect <a href=\"rules_glossary/r/resolve\">resolves</a> during the specified step.
