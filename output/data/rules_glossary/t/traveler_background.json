As such, you feel most at home when you\u2019re on the move. Traveler cards revolve primarily around making the most of <a href=\"rules_glossary/m/moments\">moment</a> cards.</p><h1 id=\"life-as-a-traveler\">Life as a Traveler</h1><p>The Valley\u2019s travelers are typically responsible for transporting goods and materials between villages and for disseminating important information to those they encounter. Most Valley Dwellers don\u2019t travel far beyond their home village, so it\u2019s the travelers who help the wider community remain connected.</p><p>Given their often social nature, some travelers are drawn toward the life of a conciliator. Many others become explorers, or even shapers, wandering new paths of both conspicuousness and experience.</p>",
