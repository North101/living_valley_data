  "content": "<p>Locations are represented in two ways in the game: as a card in the <a href=\"rules_glossary/s/surroundings\">surroundings</a> that represents where you are currently, and as a position on the <a href=\"rules_glossary/v/the_valley_map\">Valley map</a> showing where that location is relative to the other locations in the Valley.</p><p>Certain locations have notable people and places to seek out or discover on your journey. These locations are pivotal. This is listed on their card and is marked on the <a href=\"rules_glossary/v/the_valley_map\">Valley map</a> with a gold and brown eight-pointed star. These locations have sets of <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/path_cards\">path cards</a> unique to them that are added to the path deck when you <a href=\"rules_glossary/t/travel\">travel</a>, instead of three random cards from the Valley set.</p><p>Location cards follow the same rules as <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/path_cards\">path cards</a>, except there is only ever one <a href=\"rules_glossary/i/in_play\">in play</a> in the surroundings and, if it ever has <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/progress\">progress</a> equal or exceeding its <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/progress_threshold\">progress threshold</a>, it doesn't clear like a path card. Instead, during <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/phase_3_travel\">Phase 3: Travel</a>, if the location has progress equal or exceeding its progress threshold, you can choose to <a href=\"rules_glossary/t/travel\">travel</a>.</p><p>Locations are double-sided, when arriving at a new location during travel, the back of the location card is used to setup the new location.</p><h1 id=\"location-front\">Location Front</h1><img src=\"https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/assets/images/Card_Anatomies12-68e71d933da4033dcb3005082e0e3b1b.png\" /><ol><li><b>Title:</b> The name of the card.</li><li><b>Card Type and <a href=\"rules_glossary/t/traits\">Traits</a>:</b> Flavorful attributes that may be referenced by card abilities.</li><li><b><a href=\"rules_glossary/p/presence\">Presence</a>:</b> The card's prominence in the environment.
