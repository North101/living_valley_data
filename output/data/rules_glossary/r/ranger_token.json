This is cumulative for each Ranger token present.</p><ul><li>Some cards, instead of having a <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/progress_threshold\">progress threshold</a>, are marked with the Ranger symbol. These cards are <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/clear\">cleared</a>  when every Ranger's token is on the card.</li><li>When your Ranger token would be <a href=\"rules_glossary/d/discard\">discarded</a> or is not on a card, move it to your <a href=\"rules_glossary/r/role\">role</a> card.</li></ul>",
