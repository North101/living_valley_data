You can complete <a href=\"rules_glossary/m/missions\">missions</a> to progress the story, or you can head out and explore to uncover emergent moments and objectives hidden throughout the world. As you accomplish different tasks, you will be granted new cards that permanently change your deck, and your choices may have long-lasting effects on the Valley.</p><p>To start a new campaign, first at least one member of your group should  read through the rulebook or watch the Learn to Play videos found at earthbornegames.com.  Then your group has a choice on how they want to play the first session of your campaign:</p><ul><li>Experienced groups can dive right in by <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/creating_ranger_decks\">creating ranger decks</a> following the instructions on page 32 of the rulebook. Then go to entry 1 on page 4 of the <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_guide\">campaign guide</a>  to begin your campaign.</li><li>Groups with members new to Earthborne Rangers should begin by playing the <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/prologue\">Prologue</a>. The Prologue is a guided game session that gradually introduces basic concepts of the game while it walks you through building your Ranger deck. To begin, go to page 2 of the <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_guide\">campaign guide</a>  and follow the instructions there.</li></ul><p>After playing your first day, each time you return to play a new day, set up following the <a href=\"rules_glossary/s/setup\">setup</a> instructions on page 10 of the rulebook.</p><p>You are not required to play a campaign with the same Rangers session to session.

Any notable events recorded on the <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_tracker\">campaign tracker</a>  apply to all Rangers regardless of when they join.
