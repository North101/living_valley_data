Ending the day in this way is safer than ending it in the middle of navigating through a location and allows you an opportunity to prepare yourselves for the next day.</p><p>If you end the day in this way, you are allowed to swap reward cards into your Ranger decks between sessions (see <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/customizing_ranger_decks\">customizing ranger decks</a>). If you chose not to end the day, continue to step 4.</p>",
