  "content": "<p>You\u2019ll often be instructed to place two different kinds of tokens on cards: <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/progress\">progress</a> (<icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon>) and <a href=\"rules_glossary/h/harm\">harm</a> (<icon icon=\"harm\">&nbsp;</icon>).</p><p>Most cards have thresholds matching one or both of these token types on the upper-right of their text box.</p><p>When a card has tokens on it equal to or exceeding the corresponding threshold, it clears. When you clear a card, perform the following steps:</p><ol><li>Resolve any effects that trigger \"before\" the card is cleared.</li><li>Resolve any instructions that trigger \"when\" the card is cleared. This includes any effects labeled with \u201cClear\u201d on the card itself. If there is a <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_guide\">campaign guide</a>  entry noted next to \u201cClear,\u201d turn to the matching entry in the <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_guide\">campaign guide</a>  and read it aloud.</li><li>After resolving the card effects, if it still has sufficient tokens to be cleared, <a href=\"rules_glossary/d/discard\">discard</a> the card.</li><li>Resolve any instructions that trigger \"after\" the card is cleared.</li></ol><ul><li>Within each step, if there are multiple effects with the same <a href=\"rules_glossary/t/timing\">timing</a>, you decide the order in which you resolve them.</li></ul><p>When an effect causes a card to gain enough tokens to clear, finish resolving the current <a href=\"rules_glossary/r/rules_step\">rules step</a>, then clear any cards that have reached their thresholds.</p><p>For example, if a successful test places progress that clears a card, finish resolving the success effects of the test, then resolve the clear effect. Or, if a challenge effect places <a href=\"rules_glossary/h/harm\">harm</a> that clears a card, finish resolving the current challenge effect, then resolve the clear effect.</p><ul><li>If a card would clear from both token types, you can choose which type to use to clear it.</li><li>Some <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/path_cards\">path cards</a> don\u2019t have <a href=\"rules_glossary/h/harm_threshold\">harm</a> or <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/progress_threshold\">progress thresholds</a>. These cards can still receive those tokens, but they will never clear because of them.</li><li>If a card is <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/clear\">cleared</a> on your <a href=\"rules_glossary/t/turns\">turn</a>, \"you\" are considered to have cleared this card for other rules.</li></ul><h1 id=\"clearing-flowchart\">Clearing Flowchart</h1><img src=\"https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/assets/images/Flow_Charts3-15ae2264516e41966719a7ccbd078823.png\" /><h1 id=\"clearing-and-locations\">Clearing and Locations</h1><p><a href=\"rules_glossary/l/locations\">Locations</a> are an exception to the clearing rule. Every location has a <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/progress_threshold\">progress threshold</a> that represents your group\u2019s progress toward traveling to the next location. If you reach this progress threshold, however, the location does not clear. Instead, when you reach the travel step of a <a href=\"rules_glossary/r/round\">round</a>, if the location has progress equal to or exceeding its threshold, the group can choose to <a href=\"rules_glossary/t/travel\">travel</a>.</p>",
