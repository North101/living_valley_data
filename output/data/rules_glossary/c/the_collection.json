  "content": "<p>All of your cards that aren't currently being used in the game or in Ranger decks are referred to as your collection. The game box contains a number of dividers that allow you to keep your collection organized by card <a href=\"rules_glossary/s/sets\">set</a> to make it easy to build new path decks when traveling or fetch individual cards when a game effect calls for it. We recommend storing cards with their left edge facing up, allowing you to quickly look for the gray set labels on <a href=\"rules_glossary/r/ranger_cards\">Ranger cards</a> or the set icon on <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/path_cards\">path cards</a>.</p><p>While you can have any number of copies of an individual Ranger card in your collection, you are still limited in the number of certain cards that can be included in your Ranger deck. Additional copies of path, challenge, <a href=\"rules_glossary/m/missions\">mission</a>, and <a href=\"rules_glossary/l/locations\">location</a> cards beyond those found in a single copy of a product (core game or expansion), however, do not add to your collection as far as the rules of the game are concerned. For example, you are limited to the two Helping Hand <a href=\"rules_glossary/m/missions\">missions</a> in one core set box. If an effect would instruct you to put a third copy of Helping Hand into play, you cannot help that person at the moment and must instead <a href=\"rules_glossary/d/discard\">discard</a> them.</p><p>Set aside cards do not count as being in your collection.</p><img src=\"https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/assets/images/RulesRenders_0045-0f7766d28d75a86e327442b44473de7d.png\" />",
