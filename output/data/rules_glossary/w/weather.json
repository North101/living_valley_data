Much like <a href=\"rules_glossary/m/missions\">mission</a> cards, weather cards are placed in the <a href=\"rules_glossary/s/surroundings\">surroundings</a> and work like <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/path_cards\">path cards</a>, except they typically do not have <a href=\"rules_glossary/h/harm_threshold\">harm</a> or <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/progress_threshold\">progress thresholds</a>.

When they do, they maintain any tokens that were on the card.</p><h1 id=\"customizing-difficulty-with-weather\">Customizing Difficulty with Weather</h1><p>When you set up a new day, the <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_tracker\">campaign tracker</a>  recommends which weather card to use. However, groups who are looking to adjust the challenge of their game can choose to swap in a different weather card during <a href=\"rules_glossary/s/setup\">setup</a> based on the difficulty they prefer:</p><ul><li><b>Easy:</b> A Perfect Day</li><li><b>Normal:</b> Downpour</li><li><b>Hard:</b> Howling Winds</li><li><b>Expert:</b> Electric Fog</li></ul><p><i>Note: Electric Fog is not included in the \u201crecommended weather\u201d on the <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_tracker\">campaign tracker</a>  and should only be used by groups looking for an intense challenge.</i></p><h1 id=\"weather-cards\">Weather Cards</h1><img src=\"https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/assets/images/Card_Anatomies10-e4e75c490a6d8e42ccc9b2378ef8a4eb.png\"><ol><li><b>Title:</b> The name of the card.</li><li><b>Card Type and <a href=\"rules_glossary/t/traits\">Traits</a>:</b> Flavorful attributes that may be referenced by card abilities.</li><li><b>Tokens:</b> Shows the name of a special token type used for this card and the number of those tokens placed on it when it enters play.
