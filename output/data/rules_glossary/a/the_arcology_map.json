Connections between these areas are clearly marked on each level.</p><h1 id=\"locked-paths\">Locked Paths</h1><p>Some paths on the <a href=\"rules_glossary/l/legacy_of_the_ancestors_expansion\">Legacy of the Ancestors</a> map are marked with a triangular lock icon in the place where that path leaves a <a href=\"rules_glossary/l/locations\">location</a>. You cannot <a href=\"rules_glossary/t/travel\">travel</a> along these paths when leaving that <a href=\"rules_glossary/l/locations\">location</a> unless otherwise specified by another game effect. (Note: this is not in effect only when leaving the <a href=\"rules_glossary/l/locations\">location</a>, but also when you are <a href=\"rules_glossary/t/travel\">traveling</a> through that <a href=\"rules_glossary/l/locations\">location</a> as part of moving multiple <a href=\"rules_glossary/l/locations\">locations</a> at once.)</p><p><a href=\"rules_glossary/r/ranger_cards\">Ranger cards</a> that you can receive as <a href=\"rules_glossary/r/rewards\">rewards</a> during the campaign allow you to <a href=\"rules_glossary/t/travel\">travel</a> along locked paths.</p>",
