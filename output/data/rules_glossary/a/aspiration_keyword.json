  "content": "<p>An aspiration is a personal goal that an individual Ranger may wish to achieve while they patrol the Valley. Each aspiration has a corresponding narrative card that describes what inspired your Ranger to pursue it. Similar to the rules of a <a href=\"rules_glossary/m/missions\">mission</a>, completing the task described in an aspiration\u2019s rules text will unlock a <a href=\"rules_glossary/r/rewards\">reward</a> card to include in your Ranger deck.</p><p>When you add a card with the aspiration keyword to your deck during character creation, read the \u201cIntroduction\u201d aspiration narrative card matching its name and record the name of the aspiration in the notable events area of your <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_tracker\">campaign tracker</a>. You will be recording checkmarks after this entry to track your progress on this aspiration. There are two ways an aspiration can gain checkmarks.</p><ul><li><p>Aspirations that gain unique tokens (such as <a href=\"rules_glossary/g/gear\">gear</a>), add checkmarks based on those tokens. At the end of the day, record a number of checkmarks next to that aspiration\u2019s name on the <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_tracker\">campaign tracker</a> equal to the number of unique tokens on the card.</p></li><li><p>Aspirations that don\u2019t gain tokens will instead instruct you when to record progress. In these cases, record checkmarks on the <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_tracker\">campaign tracker</a> when instructed during gameplay.</p></li></ul><p>After recording any checkmarks, if the aspiration\u2019s total number of checkmarks is equal to or greater than the value indicated after the keyword, you unlock a <a href=\"rules_glossary/r/rewards\">reward</a> card unique to this aspiration. Read the \u201cAspiration Complete\u201d aspiration narrative card matching the Ranger card. This grants a new <a href=\"rules_glossary/r/rewards\">reward</a> card; however, only the Ranger that unlocked that <a href=\"rules_glossary/r/rewards\">reward</a> can include it in their deck. This is indicated by a Reward keyword on that card followed by the name of the aspiration that unlocked it.</p><p><b>Note: Cards with the aspiration keyword cannot have tokens added to them by any means except those described on the card.</b></p>",
