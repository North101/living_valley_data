  "content": "<p>The day can end in several ways:</p><ul><li><b>Choose to Camp:</b> When you successfully <a href=\"rules_glossary/t/travel\">travel</a>, the group can decide to camp for the night.\u00a0</li><li><b>Ranger too Fatigued:</b> If a Ranger needs to draw a card or suffer <a href=\"rules_glossary/f/fatigue\">fatigue</a> but cannot, the day ends immediately.</li><li><b>Ranger too Injured:</b> If a Ranger suffers their third <a href=\"rules_glossary/i/injury\">injury</a>, the day ends at the end of the current <a href=\"rules_glossary/t/turns\">turn</a>. That Ranger must add one \"Lingering Injury\" card to their deck.</li><li><b>Ally in Peril:</b> It is your duty to protect the people of the Valley. For most human beings, if they are ever <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/clear\">cleared</a>  due to <a href=\"rules_glossary/h/harm\">harm</a>, the <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_guide\">campaign guide</a>  will instruct you to end the day.</li><li><b>Mission Complete:</b> Sometimes, when the final stage of a <a href=\"rules_glossary/m/missions\">mission</a> is complete, you will reach a stopping point important enough to end the day. The <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_guide\">campaign guide</a>  will instruct you to do so.</li></ul><p>When the day ends, your current play session is over, and one day of campaign time passes. Check off the next day on the <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_tracker\">campaign tracker</a> . Save your current <a href=\"rules_glossary/l/locations\">location</a> by either storing it with your Ranger deck or writing it down on the <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_tracker\">campaign tracker</a>  along with the terrain type you were traveling on. The rest of the game materials can be packed up and returned to their normal storage locations.</p><ul><li>Only information recorded on your <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_tracker\">campaign tracker</a>  and your Ranger deck list is maintained from day to day. Any tokens on mission cards, <a href=\"rules_glossary/i/injury\">injuries</a> on Rangers, set-aside cards, or cards <a href=\"rules_glossary/i/in_play\">in play</a> such as Helping Hand are cleared off of the board and packed away at the end of the day. Even if you intend to play another day immediately after, clean up the board and follow the <a href=\"rules_glossary/s/setup\">setup</a> instructions for the new day, setting up a fresh board using your <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_tracker\">campaign tracker</a> .</li></ul>",
