Elect the lead Ranger</h2><p>Together, choose a Ranger to be the lead Ranger. The lead Ranger always draws the first <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/path_cards\">path card</a> at the start of each <a href=\"rules_glossary/r/round\">round</a> and makes decisions for the group if a consensus cannot be reached.</p><h2 id=\"4-shuffle-the-challenge-deck\">4.

Read any <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_guide\">campaign guide</a> entries listed above the current day on the <a href=\"rules_glossary/d/day_track\">day track</a>.</p><h2 id=\"7-set-up-mission-cards\">7.

Then, if you are at a pivotal location, add all <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/path_cards\">path cards</a> from the <a href=\"rules_glossary/s/sets\">set</a> matching that location. If you are not at a pivotal location, instead add three random cards from the Valley set. Finally, add any other cards added by card effects such as from the <a href=\"rules_glossary/w/weather\">weather</a>, <a href=\"rules_glossary/m/missions\">missions</a>, or the <a href=\"rules_glossary/l/locations\">location</a> (these are typically labeled \"Path Deck Assembly\").

Resolve arrival setup</h2><p>Read the campaign entry marked on the back of the location card. Then resolve each instruction under the \u201cArrival Setup\u201d header. Most cards instruct the lead Ranger to resolve an effect then have some number of \u201cnext Rangers\u201d resolve effects. If an effect calls for the \u201cnext Ranger,\u201d but each Ranger has already resolved an effect, ignore those additional effects.</p><h2 id=\"10-finishing-touches\">10. Finishing Touches</h2><p>Place any tokens as dictated by the cards <a href=\"rules_glossary/i/in_play\">in play</a>, and resolve any instructions on weather or <a href=\"rules_glossary/m/missions\">missions</a> labeled \u201cStart of Day.\u201d</p>",
