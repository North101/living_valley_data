Shuffle your Ranger deck and place it in your player area. Place a number of <a href=\"rules_glossary/e/energy\">energy</a> tokens equal to their corresponding aspect values onto your aspect card.</p><ul><li>You can <a href=\"rules_glossary/s/search\">search</a> your deck for one card with the setup <a href=\"rules_glossary/k/keywords\">keyword</a> and put it into play.</li></ul><p>Draw six cards from your Ranger deck. See <a href=\"rules_glossary/m/mulligan\">mulligan</a> for the rules on redrawing cards.</p><p>Together, choose a Ranger to be the lead Ranger. The lead Ranger always draws the first <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/path_cards\">path card</a> at the start of each <a href=\"rules_glossary/r/round\">round</a> and makes decisions for the group if a consensus cannot be reached.</p><p>Shuffle the challenge deck and place it above the <a href=\"rules_glossary/s/surroundings\">surroundings</a>.</p><p>Place your current <a href=\"rules_glossary/l/locations\">location</a> in the <a href=\"rules_glossary/s/surroundings\">surroundings</a>. If continuing a campaign, check the \"current location\" line of your <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_tracker\">campaign tracker</a> .</p><p>Find the <a href=\"rules_glossary/w/weather\">weather</a> card (or cards) noted below the current day on your <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_tracker\">campaign tracker</a> , and place it in the <a href=\"rules_glossary/s/surroundings\">surroundings</a> to the left of the location with the side named on the <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_tracker\">campaign tracker</a> faceup. Read any <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_guide\">campaign guide</a> entries listed above the current day on the <a href=\"rules_glossary/d/day_track\">day track</a>.</p><p>Find the corresponding cards for each uncompleted <a href=\"rules_glossary/m/missions\">mission</a> on your <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_tracker\">campaign tracker</a>  and place them in the <a href=\"rules_glossary/s/surroundings\">surroundings</a> to the right of the location.</p><p>First add all <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/path_cards\">path cards</a> from the <a href=\"rules_glossary/s/sets\">set</a> matching the terrain you were traveling on at the end of the previous day as noted on your <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_tracker\">campaign tracker</a> . Then, if you are at a pivotal location, add all <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/path_cards\">path cards</a> from the <a href=\"rules_glossary/s/sets\">set</a> matching that location. If you are not at a pivotal location, instead add three random cards from the Valley set. Finally, add any other cards added by card effects such as from the <a href=\"rules_glossary/w/weather\">weather</a>, <a href=\"rules_glossary/m/missions\">missions</a>, or the <a href=\"rules_glossary/l/locations\">location</a> (these are typically labeled \"Path Deck Assembly\"). Shuffle those cards together and place them above the <a href=\"rules_glossary/s/surroundings\">surroundings</a>.</p><p><i>Note: See Build the Path Deck for a more detailed explanation of these steps.</i></p><p>Read the campaign entry marked on the back of the location card. Then resolve each instruction under the \"Arrival Setup\" header. Most cards instruct the lead Ranger to resolve an effect then have some number of \"next Rangers\" resolve effects. If an effect calls for the \"next Ranger,\" but each Ranger has already resolved an effect, ignore those additional effects.</p><p>Place any tokens as dictated by the cards <a href=\"rules_glossary/i/in_play\">in play</a>, and resolve any instructions on weather or <a href=\"rules_glossary/m/missions\">missions</a> labeled \"Start of Day.\"</p>",
