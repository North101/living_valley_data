  "content": "<p><a href=\"rules_glossary/s/spirit_speaker_specialty\">Spirit Speakers</a> are adept at interacting with beings in the spirit realm, but to do so, they must first enter the trance-like state known as \u201cspiritspeaking.\u201d When a Ranger does this, they gain the ability to interact with spirit beings. In this state they can also influence the physical world in ways they could not previously.</p><p>When an ability instructs you to spiritspeak, <a href=\"rules_glossary/e/exhaust\">exhaust</a> your <a href=\"rules_glossary/r/role\">role</a> and replace your <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/common_test\">Common Tests</a> card with the Spirit Speaker Tests card. While you are spiritspeaking:</p><ul><li>You no longer have access to <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/common_test\">common tests</a>.</li><li>You cannot perform any <a href=\"rules_glossary/t/tests\">tests</a> that are not printed on, or used to interact with, a spirit.</li><li>You can perform any of the <a href=\"rules_glossary/t/tests\">tests</a> on the Spirit Speaker Tests card (the Influence test can be used on any type of being, not just Spirits).</li></ul><p>When you <a href=\"rules_glossary/r/ready\">ready</a> your <a href=\"rules_glossary/r/role\">role</a> (either during the <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/phase_4_refresh\">refresh phase</a> or due to another effect), you stop spiritspeaking. Replace your Spirit Speaker Tests card with the <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/common_test\">Common Tests</a> card.</p><p><b>Note: The Descendant of the Guide <a href=\"rules_glossary/r/role\">role</a> does not instruct you to spiritspeak when it is <a href=\"rules_glossary/e/exhaust\">exhausted</a>. Instead, it instructs you to perform a single <a href=\"rules_glossary/t/tests\">test</a> from the Spirit Speaker Test card.</b></p>",
