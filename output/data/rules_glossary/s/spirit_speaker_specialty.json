As such, in a similar fashion to an Elder, one might consult their village\u2019s spirit speaker about matters of great import or when the way forward may be unclear. Spirit Speakers who join the Rangers are prized as patrol mates, for their helping spirits often prove to be the  difference in a given mission\u2019s success.</p>",
