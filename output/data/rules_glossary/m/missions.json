When this happens, record its name on the <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_tracker\">campaign tracker</a>  and the current day in the box to its left. Then find the corresponding mission card, and put it into play in the <a href=\"rules_glossary/s/surroundings\">surroundings</a>. On the <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_tracker\">campaign tracker</a> , each line of the mission has three boxes to the right that some missions use to track progress.</p><p>During <a href=\"rules_glossary/s/setup\">setup</a>, for each mission on your <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_tracker\">campaign tracker</a>  that hasn\u2019t yet been completed, put that mission\u2019s card into play in the <a href=\"rules_glossary/s/surroundings\">surroundings</a>.</p><p>Missions work much the same way as <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/path_cards\">path cards</a>, except they typically do not have <a href=\"rules_glossary/h/harm_threshold\">harm</a> or <a href=\"rules_glossary/p/progress_threshold\">progress thresholds</a>. If a mission card would be <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/clear\">cleared</a>  or <a href=\"rules_glossary/d/discard\">discarded</a> by other game effects, it is instead returned to the <a href=\"rules_glossary/s/surroundings\">surroundings</a> (or wherever it would be placed at the beginning of a day). When a mission card which is attached to a card in another area becomes unattached, return it to the surroundings. Missions can only be removed from play by completing them (or other special instructions on the mission itself). When a mission is complete, cross it off on the <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/campaign_tracker\">campaign tracker</a>  and return its card to the <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/the_collection\">collection</a> .</p><p>Most missions have an objective listed inside a green box. When this condition is met, read the next entry in the mission\u2019s story.</p><h1 id=\"mission-subjects\">Mission Subjects</h1><p>Some missions have subjects listed in their name in parenthesis\u2014for example, \u201cTrack (Quisi Vos).\u201d These subjects are either a <a href=\"rules_glossary/l/locations\">location</a> card or path card, and are used by the mission in some way. When a mission is listed with a subject, find the subject\u2019s card in your <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/the_collection\">collection</a>  and attach it <a href=\"rules_glossary/f/facedown_cards\">facedown</a> to the mission.
