  "content": "<p>Some cards call for a group test. These <a href=\"rules_glossary/t/tests\">tests</a> represent more daunting tasks that require the Rangers to work together. These <a href=\"rules_glossary/t/tests\">tests</a> typically have difficulty values that scale based on how many Rangers are in the game.</p><p>Group tests work like regular <a href=\"rules_glossary/t/tests\">tests</a>, except any Ranger can contribute effort to this test via <a href=\"rules_glossary/e/energy\">energy</a> and <a href=\"rules_glossary/a/approach_icons\">approach icons</a>. At least one <a href=\"rules_glossary/e/energy\">energy</a> must be <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/commit\">committed</a> to the <a href=\"rules_glossary/t/tests\">test</a>, but it can be from any Ranger. If no other Ranger decides to <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/commit\">commit</a> <a href=\"rules_glossary/e/energy\">energy</a>, the active Ranger must <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/commit\">commit</a> one. Only one <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/challenge_cards\">challenge card</a> is drawn for the test.</p><p>When resolving <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/challenge_effects\">challenge effects</a>, the Ranger that drew the path moment resolves each effect in the <a href=\"rules_glossary/s/surroundings\">surroundings</a> and <a href=\"rules_glossary/a/along_the_way\">along the way</a>. Then, each Ranger who <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/commit\">committed</a> <a href=\"rules_glossary/e/effort\">effort</a> to the <a href=\"rules_glossary/t/tests\">test</a> resolves <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/challenge_effects\">challenge effects</a> <a href=\"rules_glossary/w/within_reach\">within reach</a>. During this process, all cards <a href=\"rules_glossary/w/within_reach\">within reach</a> of a Ranger who <a href=\"rules_glossary/c/commit\">committed</a> <a href=\"rules_glossary/e/effort\">effort</a> are considered <a href=\"rules_glossary/a/active\">active</a>.</p>",
