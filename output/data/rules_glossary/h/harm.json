What it represents varies considerably from card to card. On <a href=\"rules_glossary/b/beings\">beings</a>  it may represent physical harm, but it can also represent distress. On <a href=\"rules_glossary/f/features\">features</a> it may represent how much damage a physical object can suffer before it breaks, or the process of hacking a path through the brush. It can also be a measure of how much material can be harvested from a plant before nothing of use remains.</p><p>Your instinct may be to think of a card\u2019s <a href=\"rules_glossary/h/harm_threshold\">harm threshold</a> as its \u201chit points,\u201d that is, the amount of damage it can sustain before it is killed or destroyed, but that it not necessarily the case. You clear a card with harm when the amount of harm equals or exceeds its <a href=\"rules_glossary/h/harm_threshold\">harm threshold</a>. This means you've simply done enough damage or caused enough distress to cause it to flee. When you clear a feature from harm, you\u2019ve overcome it through force or have depleted it of its resources.</p>",
