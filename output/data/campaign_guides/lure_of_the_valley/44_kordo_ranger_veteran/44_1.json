One you immediately recognize as Kordo Haverson, but it takes a moment before you recognize the other as Spirit Speaker Nal. You don\u2019t think you\u2019ve heard her raise her voice before.</p><p>You push forward and come across the two of them in the midst of a heated debate. Kordo\u2019s face is flushed, and Nal has her arms crossed and is glaring. Although you\u2019re not sure what\u2019s going on, you feel like you should step in.</p></blockquote><p>If Nal is not in play, search the path deck for her, and put her into play in the same area as Kordo. Do not read her normal entry.</p><p>Go to <a href=\"campaign_guides/lure_of_the_valley/45_spirit_speaker_nal/45_4\">45.4</a>.</p>",
