  "content": "<blockquote><p>As you ascend the slope, Jaris sprints ahead of you to the top. You circle around the dais of overgrown stone at the summit of the knoll, and you set down your packs and make camp. In the failing light of evening, you drift off to sleep.</p><p>You wake with a start. You sit up. All is dark and still. You realize you\u2019re alone. The bedrolls are empty. A chill runs up your spine as you look frantically around the dais. Then, as you stand at the center of the knoll, you hear a rustling in the grass \u2026 just behind you.</p></blockquote><p>Set aside your other game components. Shuffle the challenge discard into the challenge deck.</p><p>Starting with the lead Ranger, going clockwise, each Ranger may draw a challenge card and place it faceup in front of them, or choose to pass. Once a Ranger passes, they are out, and cannot draw any more challenge cards.</p><p>If a Ranger draws a challenge card with a <icon icon=\"reshuffle\">&nbsp;</icon> icon, they may choose to place it in front of a different Ranger who has not passed.</p><p>When any Ranger has a matching pair of challenge icons in front of them. Do the following based on which icon there\u2019s a pair of:</p><p><b>2 or more <icon icon=\"sun\">&nbsp;</icon>:</b> You have conquered your fears! Gain the Face Your Fears reward card.</p><p><b>2 or more <icon icon=\"mountain\">&nbsp;</icon>:</b> You gain flashes of insight into your near future. Scout 6 path cards and gain 1 energy of each aspect.</p><p><b>2 or more <icon icon=\"crest\">&nbsp;</icon>:</b> Fear overwhelms you! Suffer 1 injury, and discard all the challenge cards in front of you. You may not draw any more or have cards placed in front of you.</p><p>Once all Rangers have passed or been overwhelmed by fear, continue.</p><blockquote><p>You sit up to find the knoll still bathed in the dull red glow of late evening. Jaris sits up as well, gasping suddenly, then visibly relaxes when he sees you. For a long moment, you silently stare at each other. Jaris shudders. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d he says.</p><p>You clasp Jaris on the shoulder and congratulate him on being tough enough to sleep on Greenbriar Knoll.</p><p>Jaris places his hand on your shoulder, clearly affected. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t at all like people said. It was like the knoll was trying to get me to understand something. I\u2019m not sure what.\u201d Jaris gives you a rare smile, then starts down the trail back to Meadow.</p></blockquote><p>Discard Jaris. Return <b>HELPING HAND</b> to the collection. Write <span color=\"blue\">FACED YOUR DEEPEST FEARS</span> on the campaign tracker. Shuffle the challenge discard into the challenge deck.</p>",
