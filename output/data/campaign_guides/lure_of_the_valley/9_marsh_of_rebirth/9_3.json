  "content": "<blockquote><p>The bunker is so covered in mud and reeds that it looks like just another hillock rising out of the swamp, but you spot a corner of dull carbon composite peeking through the grass. You find a hatch, pry it open, and cautiously climb into the black, cavernous interior.</p><p>Once inside, you see a series of rooms. Most are empty and overgrown, but in one room you find what appears to be a small dish of liquid metal with Estian script along the rim. You apply a universal power cell to the recharge port, and with some fiddling, you activate the device. Ripples flash across the surface, and suddenly the metal reforms into a topographical map of the swamp, replicated in stunning detail.</p></blockquote><p>Gain the Topographone reward card.</p>",
