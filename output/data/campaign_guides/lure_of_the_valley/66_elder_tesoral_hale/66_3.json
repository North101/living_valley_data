If you ever need to find anyone else, make your way to Evergreen Hall, order a sweet wine, and start chatting away. All of the comings and goings of the Valley somehow find their way there.</p><p>He gives you a knowing nod. \u201cIf you are looking for a bit more excitement here in Branch, I\u2019m sure Seilo could use a hand or two with harvesting his honey. Also, Lyn Mira, our local woodworker, makes excellent canoes. Give her a shout and she\u2019d be more than happy to show you!\u201d</p><p><b>If you are on REMOVE THE RECLAIMERS:</b> As Tesoral wraps up, you bring up the reclaimer threat and ask him for ideas. \"Ha! We're craftspeople here in Branch. You're better off asking the more wild folks like Kasende down in Tumbledown. Or maybe one of the shapers. I think a couple of have taken up residence in Spire. A brother and sister?\"</p></blockquote>",
