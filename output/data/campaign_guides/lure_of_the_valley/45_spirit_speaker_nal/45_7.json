One of those, interestingly enough, is the spirit of the Verdessa. It shares a deep connection with the spirit of the Valley\u2014like a mother to her child\u2014and for some reason, I cannot reach it. It's very distressing.</p><p>\"I've received word that a wandering botanist has recently returned from an excursion to the Verdessa, and that she's brought some rare plant specimens along with her. She is currently staying at the merchant's quarters in Kobo's Market. If I had one of these specimens, I may be able to use it to reconnect with the spirit of the Verdessa. Perhaps you could accompany me to the market? I would be very grateful.\"</p></blockquote><choice id=\"rangers-choose\">RANGERS CHOOSE</choice><p><span color=\"red\">A) Accompany Nal to Kobo\u2019s Market.</span> Discard all <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> and attach the <b>HELPING HAND</b> mission to Spirit Speaker Nal.</p><p><span color=\"red\">B) Some other time.</span> Discard Spirit Speaker Nal.
