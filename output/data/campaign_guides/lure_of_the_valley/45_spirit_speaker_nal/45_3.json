You assume it\u2019s best not to interrupt whatever she\u2019s doing, and wait quietly for a few minutes.</p><p>The Spirit Speakers of the Valley are the most adept at communicating with the world beyond the visible\u2014spirits great and small as well as those of the ancestors.</p><p>Nal's gifts are greater still. For with the help of a device crafted by Ben Amon, she is able to communicate over great distances, projecting images and emotions into the minds of Rangers in the field.</p><p>After several minutes, she opens her eyes and speaks. \u201cThe spirit of the Valley was eager to tell me that you were coming,\u201d she says. She turns to you and smiles warmly. \u201cHow can I help? If you need me to send a message, I may not be able to at the moment. The spirit of the Verdessa, the great jungle to the South, has gone silent. I don't know why. I feel like I need to get to the bottom of it before I do anything else. I'll be too distracted otherwise. Something's wrong.\u201d</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear Nal with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to ask how you can help.</i></p>",
