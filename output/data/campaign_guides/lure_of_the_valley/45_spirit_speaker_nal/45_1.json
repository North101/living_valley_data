One you immediately recognize as Kordo Haverson's, but it takes a moment before you recognize the other as that of Spirit Speaker Nal. You don't think you've heard her raise her voice before.</p><p>You find the two of them in the midst of a heated debate. Kordo's face is flushed, and Nal has her arms crossed and is glaring. Although you're not sure what's going on, you feel like you should step in.</p></blockquote><p>If Kordo is not in play, search the path deck for him, and put him into play in the same area as Nal. Do not read his \"enters play\" entry. Then go to <a href=\"campaign_guides/lure_of_the_valley/45_spirit_speaker_nal/45_4\"><entry>45.4</entry></a>.</p>",
