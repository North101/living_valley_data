  "content": "<blockquote><p>From one of Lone Tree's balconies, you hear the voices of two people arguing. One you immediately recognize as Kordo Haverson's, but it takes a moment before you recognize the other as that of Spirit Speaker Nal. You don\u2019t think you\u2019ve heard her raise her voice before.</p><p>You find the two of them in the midst of a heated debate. Kordo\u2019s face is flushed, and Nal has her arms crossed and is glaring. Although you\u2019re not sure what\u2019s going on, you feel like you should step in.</p></blockquote><p>If Kordo is not in play, search the path deck for him, and put him into play in the same area as Nal. Do not read his \u201centers play\u201d entry. Then go to <a href=\"campaign_guides/lure_of_the_valley/45_spirit_speaker_nal/45_4\">45.4</a>.</p>",
