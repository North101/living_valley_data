  "content": "<blockquote id=\"narration_1\"><p>High atop Lone Tree Station you'll find a series of circular platforms of polished wood and forged carbon. During your training, on clear, windless days, these platforms served as a refuge. You would often spend your free time in the afternoons bathing there in the sun, sitting in quiet contemplation and looking out over the mirrored surface of White Sky Lake. You'd also look wistfully at the airship known as the Swift, it's hull gleaming in the sun, as Ben Amon would climb aboard and launch it into the air.</p><p>The legs of the vehicle would compress and then extend with a sudden movement, propelling it upwards with tremendous force. Then, once it reached its apex, its wings would unfurl, and the glider would soundlessly soar toward the horizon, steadily descending as it flew toward its destination.</p><p>Calypsa told you and the other initiates that it was prone to roll and crash in inclement weather, and if you flew it any great distance, its energy cells would drain, and the Swift would grow inert, unable to launch for days before the cells recharged.</p><p>All this was clearly meant to dissuade you from taking the Swift out on your own, but when you look at the airship, you can't help but feel a surge of excitement. To soar high above the Valley would surely be exhilarating, if not a little terrifying. Now that you're a full-fledged Ranger, perhaps you can convince the crew to take you for a ride.</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear Topside Mast with <icon icon=\"ranger_token\">&nbsp;</icon> to take the Swift for a ride.</i></p>",
