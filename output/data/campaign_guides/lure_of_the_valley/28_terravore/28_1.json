The light quickly fades away as you go deeper, and the air becomes thicker and thicker. The ground becomes more jumbled and chaotic as well, and you see rocks and tree trunks giving way to smaller, splintered chunks.</p><p>Eventually you come to a smoking, bubbling pool that seems to block your progress. You look around and manage to find two routes. There seems to be a path along the side of the pool, near a series of protrusions that look uncomfortably like rib bones in the side of the terravore. However, there is also a particularly large log half-submerged in the pool that it looks like you could crawl across.</p></blockquote><choice id=\"rangers-choose\">Rangers Choose</choice><p color=\"red\">A) Take the path along the side.</p><p>Draw a challenge card.</p><blockquote><p><b>If the card has a <span><icon icon=\"sun\">&nbsp;</icon></span> icon:</b> You safely make it to the other side of the pool, although you flinch once or twice when you hear a strange skittering above you.</p><p><b>Otherwise:</b> You are about halfway around the pool when dozens of pale, blind mites the size of your hand drop down from the ceiling and skitter all over you.

It appears to be a vine, something not of the terravore but linked to it, with fine hair-like roots burrowing into its flesh. As you inspect it, it seems like this links into the biomeld\u2019s nervous system. You figure out how to detach it, and wonder if maybe you could link it to yours, and what it would do?</p></blockquote><p>Gain the Dendritic Vine reward card.</p>",
