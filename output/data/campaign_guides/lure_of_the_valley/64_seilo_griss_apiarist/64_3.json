Smoke from the bee smoker stings your nose, and in the haze, you see Seilo gently place the hive back on its branch and wave you over. As you approach, he's already dipping a trembling finger into the honey, eyes wide with anticipation. One taste and his body relaxes, his eyes dazzle with a thousand distant stars, and a big smile creeps up his lips.</p><p>In a calm, deep voice he says, \"Now if that isn't heaven on Earth, I don't know what is. Give it a taste!\" He passes you the jar. \"Unlike anything ever touched these lips. Am I right? I think I'll call it \u2026 The Philosopher's Honey. Now, I have to harvest more while the little buzzers are still sleepin'. Head on off now, but don't tell anyone \u2026 This will be the biggest thing since the ancestors left the arcologies. You wait and see!\"</p></blockquote><p>Gain the <reward>Philosopher's Honey</reward> reward card. Discard Seilo, and return <mission>HELPING HAND</mission> to the collection.
