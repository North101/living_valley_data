Smoke from the bee smoker stings your nose, and in the haze, you see Seilo gently place the hive back on its branch and wave you over. As you approach, he\u2019s already dipping a trembling finger into the honey, eyes wide with anticipation. One taste and his body relaxes, his eyes dazzle with a thousand distant stars, and a big smile creeps up his lips.</p><p>In a calm, deep voice he says, \u201cNow if that isn\u2019t heaven on Earth, I don\u2019t know what is. Give it a taste!\u201d He passes you the jar. \u201cUnlike anything ever touched these lips. Am I right? I think I\u2019ll call it \u2026 The Philosopher\u2019s Honey. Now, I have to harvest more while the little buzzers are still sleepin\u2019. Head on off now, but don\u2019t tell anyone \u2026 This will be the biggest thing since the ancestors left the arcologies. You wait and see!\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Gain the Philosopher\u2019s Honey reward card. Discard Seilo, and return <b>HELPING HAND</b> to the collection.
