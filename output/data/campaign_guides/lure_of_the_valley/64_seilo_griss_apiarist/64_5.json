Well, what did I say? An absolute sensation! Can't even catch a moment for myself without someone chasin' me down for more Philosopher's Honey.\"</p><p>He leans against a nearby tree. \"I keep telling em' takes time to harvest. But they won't take no for an answer. Got me thinkin' I might just transplant a few of them trees down here in Branch. But that'll take some time. I don't say this word often but \u2026 Please, could you help me gather more from the Philosopher's Garden? I've done three trips already in the last week!\"</p></blockquote><p><span color=\"red\">A) Agree to help.</span> Discard all <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon>, and attach the <mission>HELPING HAND</mission> mission to Seilo.</p><p><span color=\"red\">B) Not today.</span> Discard Seilo.
