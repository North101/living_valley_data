You follow them around the base of the tree only to find a man in a beekeeper\u2019s shroud carefully examining a tray of honey. \u201cWhere are you? I know you\u2019re hiding somewhere \u2026 \u201d He leans closer and laughs. \u201cWhy hello, your highness!\u201d</p><p>The man finally notices you and gives you a theatrical bow. \u201cWelcome! Name is Seilo Griss! Though I\u2019m sure you knew that already. I suppose you\u2019re looking for some honey then. They always are \u2026 Best honey in the Valley.\u201d He winks and swaggers toward you. \u201cWell, nothing\u2019s for free in this world. You get your hands sticky and help me with this harvest, then maybe I\u2019ll give you a taste \u2026 \u201d</p></blockquote><p><i><p class=\"text text_blue\">Clear Seilo with <span><icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon></span> to help him with harvesting his honey.</p></i></p>",
