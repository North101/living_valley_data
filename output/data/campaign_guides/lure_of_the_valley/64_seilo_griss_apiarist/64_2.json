You follow them around the base of the tree only to find a man in a beekeeper's shroud carefully examining a tray of honey. \"Where are you? I know you're hiding somewhere \u2026 \" He leans closer and laughs. \"Why hello, your highness!\"</p><p>The man finally notices you and gives you a theatrical bow. \"Welcome! Name is Seilo Griss! Though I'm sure you knew that already. I suppose you're looking for some honey then. They always are \u2026 Best honey in the Valley.\" He winks and swaggers toward you. \"Well, nothing's for free in this world. You get your hands sticky and help me with this harvest, then maybe I'll give you a taste \u2026 \"</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear Seilo with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to help him with harvesting his honey.</i></p>",
