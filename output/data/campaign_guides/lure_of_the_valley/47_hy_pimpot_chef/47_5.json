But instead you see Hy scrambling with his oversized pack, pulling out his portable Sol coil and pot. \u201cGet me water,\u201d he shouts as he pulls some leaves from a bush along the trail. \u201cThis needs to go into the pot immediately, and the rest of the ingredients have aged \u2026 perfectly!\u201d</p><p>You watch in bemused amusement as he dashes around the impromptu outdoor kitchen, dicing, slicing, mashing, frying, and at one point, smoking, the varied ingredients you and he worked so hard to gather. Finally, he raises his head from the steaming pot. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 \u201d he says, his voice quavering. \u201c ... just try it.\u201d</p><p>You gather around the pot, dipping your spoons into the fragrant broth. It is quite simply the best soup, and possibly the best food, you\u2019ve ever had. The complex flavors blend perfectly, rich but not overpowering, fresh but hearty, warm and soothing yet light and effervescent. Your only regret, as you set down your spoon and realize the pot is empty, is that you may never taste something quite that good again.</p><p>Hy has a beatific smile on his face. \u201cThe best it\u2019s ever been,\u201d he says.</p><p>You all sit in contented silence for a while, before you get up the courage to ask Hy exactly how he made the soup. The master chef nods. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you the recipe,\u201d he says. \u201cAs long as you promise to remember it, and practice it. Someday, I want you to serve me something even better than this!\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Discard each flora attached to Hy. Each Ranger soothes 4 fatigue.
