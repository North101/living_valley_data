It's said that every Ranger in the Valley has tried to teach Hy Pimpot a new song to whistle, but none of them have succeeded.</p><p>Eventually you spot the stout little gnome of a man intently chopping and mixing vinegary-smelling herbs and vegetables into a large bowl. \"Good, good, you're here,\" he says without looking at you. \"Try this stew. I need to know if I've hit the right balance between 'pleasant heat' and 'tongue searing.' What does it need? Kelpweed? Mourning Root?\"</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>You can help Hy Pimpot by gathering ingredients for the stew, or you can clear him with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to ask him how to make the stew as good as possible.</i></p>",
