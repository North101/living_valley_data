All of it goes into his large pot, which he sets to boiling with the biggest Sol coil you've ever seen.</p><p>After an hour, he emerges from his kitchen with a platter of wooden bowls, each steaming with a fragrant aroma. He passes one to each of you. You taste it gingerly, then start taking bigger and bigger spoonfuls. The soup is amazing! Fresh and light, but also hearty and filling all at once! You clamber for seconds as you heap effusive praise on the master chef.</p><p>Hy nods and smiles, but he seems distracted. \"Thank you, thank you,\" he says. \"But you know \u2026 \" He thinks for a while. \"Some of those ingredients just aren't as fresh as they could be. The gloomcaps, for example, I can tell they were in your pack for at least five hours. And the moss cherries \u2026 ah!\" His eyes brighten. \"Imagine how good it would be if I traveled with you, and cooked in the field, with herbs and spices picked right off the stem!\"</p></blockquote><p>Discard each flora attached to Hy. Each Ranger soothes 4 fatigue.</p>",
