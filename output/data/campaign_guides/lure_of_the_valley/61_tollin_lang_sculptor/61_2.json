  "content": "<blockquote id=\"narration_1\"><p>The glow alerts you to Tollin Lang's presence before you actually find him, crouched next to a heavy bag and rounded, hemispherical pedestal. Above the pedestal, you see a whirling rainbow mass of sparkling shards of glass. Even as you watch, Tollin reaches into the bag\u2014while wearing a heavy glove\u2014and hauls out another handful of shards, carefully casting them into the air. You see the brief flash of an otherwise invisible suspensor field, and the shards join the larger cloud. Tollin thinks for a moment, then uses a pole to nudge and push the material into a new form. You've heard of kinetic glass before, but this is the first time you've seen it used in such a quantity.</p><p>Tollin looks at you as you approach and waves. He starts chatting with you as he continues to sculpt.</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear Tollin with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to ask him about his sculpture.</i></p>",
