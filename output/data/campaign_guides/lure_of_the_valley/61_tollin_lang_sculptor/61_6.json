Something to commemorate its construction, you know? Anyway, I\u2019ve created the design, but now I have to haul nearly one hundred kilos of kinetic glass and materials there.\u201d He looks faintly abashed. \u201cI \u2026 may have gotten carried away.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly he brightens. \u201cHey, you travel all over the Valley, right? Could you help me take the sculpture to Stoneweaver Bridge? I bet it would be really easy if we had a boat; maybe one of the ones Lyn Mira makes out in Branch? But we could just carry the materials there too.\u201d</p></blockquote><choice id=\"rangers-choose\">RANGERS CHOOSE</choice><p><span color=\"red\">A) Agree to help.</span> Discard all <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon>, and attach the <b>HELPING HAND</b> mission to Tollin.</p><p><span color=\"red\">B) Not today.</span> Discard Tollin.
