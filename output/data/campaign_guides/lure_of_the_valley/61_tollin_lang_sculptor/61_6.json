Something to commemorate its construction, you know? Anyway, I've created the design, but now I have to haul nearly one hundred kilos of kinetic glass and materials there.\" He looks faintly abashed. \"I \u2026 may have gotten carried away.\"</p><p>Suddenly he brightens. \"Hey, you travel all over the Valley, right? Could you help me take the sculpture to Stoneweaver Bridge? I bet it would be really easy if we had a boat; maybe one of the ones Lyn Mira makes out in Branch? But we could just carry the materials there too.\"</p></blockquote><p><span color=\"red\">A) Agree to help.</span> Discard all <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon>, and attach the <mission>HELPING HAND</mission> mission to Tollin.</p><p><span color=\"red\">B) Not today.</span> Discard Tollin.
