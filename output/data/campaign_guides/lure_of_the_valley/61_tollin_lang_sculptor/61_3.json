  "content": "<blockquote id=\"narration_1\"><p>With a final flourish, Tollin steps back and fiddles with the controls on a pair of suspensor pedestals he\u2019s put on the sides of the bridge. With a musical crashing and tinkling sound, the mound of kinetic glass shakes and rises. Slowly it forms into an abstract human shape, surrounded by a spiraling swirl of stone. Even as you watch, the shape slowly moves their arms, and the stones solidify into a sparkling obsidian obelisk that envelops the figure, before breaking apart and returning to its swirling spiral.</p><p>Tollin watches with a satisfied smile. \u201cThe hardest kinetic glass work I\u2019ve ever attempted,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd thanks to you, it was a success.\u201d</p><p>He reaches into his bag and pulls out a hemisphere roughly the size of his palm, along with a large leather pouch. \u201cHere,\u201d he hands it to you. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have anything more practical to give you in return, but this is a sculpture I did of a rabbit when I was practicing my realism. I thought you might like it, or \u2026 \u201d he trails off, then laughs. \u201cMaybe you can use it as a decoy!\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Gain the Kinetic Glass Sculpture reward card.
