She thinks for a moment, then leans back with a deep and satisfied sigh. \"I love it.\" She looks at you. \"Thank you so much.\"</p><p>\"Oh!\" She exclaims and rummages around in her rucksack. \"I want you to have something.\" She pulls out a well-used sketchbook and hands it to you. \"Drawings of flora and fauna from all over the Valley from when I was just starting out. There are a few blank pages left. I think you should be the one to fill them. See you next masterpiece!\" She winks at you then begins to pack away her supplies.</p></blockquote><p>Gain the <reward>Sil's Sketchbook</reward> reward card.
