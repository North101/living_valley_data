  "content": "<blockquote><p>Even outside the compound, you hear the muted roar of the Carbon Forge and smell the sharp tang of ozone. Once beyond the wall, you can see the squat bulbous shape of the Forge itself, a gray kiln larger than three wagons. As you watch, a trio of sweating artificers haul a series of heavy curved beams out of the Forge\u2019s mouth; frames for a roof. Another rushes forward to shovel graphite shards into a small hatch on the side. Blue sparks flicker within, and your hair stands on end as the Forge begins to reform the graphite into nano-assembled carbon items.</p></blockquote>",
