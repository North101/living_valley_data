A woman heaves an axe up, sweat dripping from her brow. Around her are an assortment of finely carved objects lazily strewn on work benches and old stumps. She waves you over as she grabs a tool you've never seen before, a long-handled device lined in a power casing.</p><p>\"To what do I owe the pleasure?\" She clicks a button on the handle revealing a molten wire, humming with energy. \"Laser cutter. Bark of the dolewood is woven so tight you need to heat the surface if you're gonna cut through it.\" She slowly begins hewing away at the bark of a long piece of dolewood. Next to it you spy an intricately engraved collapsible canoe. The craftsmanship is spectacular.</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear Lyn with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to ask her about the boat.</i></p>",
