  "content": "<blockquote><p>The sound of metal splitting wood and the scent of fresh sawdust wafts toward you as you approach. A woman heaves an axe up, sweat dripping from her brow. Around her are an assortment of finely carved objects lazily strewn on work benches and old stumps. She waves you over as she grabs a tool you\u2019ve never seen before, a long-handled device lined in a power casing.</p><p>\u201cTo what do I owe the pleasure?\u201d She clicks a button on the handle revealing a molten wire, humming with energy. \u201cLaser cutter. Bark of the dolewood is woven so tight you need to heat the surface if you\u2019re gonna cut through it.\u201d She slowly begins hewing away at the bark of a long piece of dolewood. Next to it you spy an intricately engraved collapsible canoe. The craftsmanship is spectacular.</p></blockquote><p><i><p class=\"text text_blue\">Clear Lyn with <span><icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon></span> to ask her about the boat.</p></i></p>",
