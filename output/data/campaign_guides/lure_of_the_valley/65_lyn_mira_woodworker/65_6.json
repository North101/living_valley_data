You ask about her work, almost in a whisper as to not disturb the ritual.</p><p>\"Been building these canoes now for almost fifteen years. Handy little guys. Designs been passed down for generations. Collapsible, lightweight and durable. Perfect for you lot. Come with me to High Basin where there's the right kind of wood to be found. Now, I could carve it for you \u2026 but if you want her to take care of you, you need to know every notch and groove. Come with me, and I'll show you how to make one.\"</p></blockquote><p><span color=\"red\">A) Agree.</span> Discard all <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon>, and attach the <mission>HELPING HAND</mission> mission to Lyn.</p><p><span color=\"red\">B) Not today.</span> Discard Lyn. Each Ranger soothes 2 fatigue.</p>",
