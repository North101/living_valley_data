You look up and realize you've lost track of time, the carving process was so engrossing it felt as if time slipped away like a silent stream flowing on toward dusk. She eyes your work admiringly.</p><p>\"I must say, I'm impressed. Took me more than a few goes before I managed to make something like this.\" You thank her for the compliment and her help, and she clasps you on the shoulder. \"Of course! Should be rapids ready. Try collapsing it for storage, and if you'd like, there's a creek about a mile east of here where you can give her a test run.\"</p></blockquote><p>Gain the <reward>Dolewood Canoe</reward> reward card.
