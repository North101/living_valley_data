You look up and realize you\u2019ve lost track of time, the carving process was so engrossing it felt as if time slipped away like a silent stream flowing on toward dusk. She eyes your work admiringly.</p><p>\u201cI must say, I\u2019m impressed. Took me more than a few goes before I managed to make something like this.\u201d You thank her for the compliment and her help, and she clasps you on the shoulder. \u201cOf course! Should be rapids ready. Try collapsing it for storage, and if you\u2019d like, there\u2019s a creek about a mile east of here where you can give her a test run.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Gain the Dolewood Canoe reward card. Discard Lyn, and return <b>HELPING HAND</b> to the collection. Write <span color=\"blue\">CARVED A DOLEWOOD CANOE</span> on the campaign tracker.</p>",
