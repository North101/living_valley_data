See, I believe this was once a dam, holding back a \u2026 a huge lake, maybe a small sea. When it ruptured, the water would've swept through the Valley, submerging and reshaping the ecosystem. It eventually drained into the Verdessa, leaving behind aquatic life forms. As they decomposed, they would have left strong deposits of calcium in the soil, which would have enriched and accelerated the regrowth of the Valley's floor.\"</p><p>He looks to you. \"If I were able to test two samples, one from here and another from say\u2026 White Sky, Branch or Spire, I could determine if the same calcium deposits are indeed present! I know the paths can be winding and dangerous, but maybe you'd be willing to accompany me?\"</p></blockquote><p><span color=\"red\">A) Agree to help.</span> Discard all <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> and attach the <mission>HELPING HAND</mission> mission to Silaro.</p><p><span color=\"red\">B) Not today.</span> Discard Silaro.
