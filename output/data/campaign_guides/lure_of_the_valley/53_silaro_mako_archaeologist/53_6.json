Worn from your journey, you finally rest in the nook of a hollowed tree trunk, which, for once, seems to hug every curve of your aching body. Just as you begin to drift off, you're startled awake by Silaro's joyous cry.</p><p>\"Yes! And not only the same percentage of calcium enrichment but dating back to approximately the same time!\" He begins to pace in concentric circles, each circle sending him farther and farther into the forest. His voice drifts away but you manage to make out, \"after the flood \u2026 no noticeable decay of arcology technology across \u2026 a flood this powerful must have scoured the Valley of life \u2026\"</p></blockquote><p>Gain the <reward>Silaro's Insight</reward> reward card. Discard Silaro, and return <mission>HELPING HAND</mission> to the collection. Write <event>PROVED SILARO'S HYPOTHESIS</event> on the campaign tracker. Then return and read the intro to the location as normal.</p>",
