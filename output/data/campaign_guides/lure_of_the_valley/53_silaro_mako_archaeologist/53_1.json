This time though, he seems particularly intrigued by what looks like the shell of a giant power coupling protruding from a crack in the wall some two meters above him. He doesn't seem to notice your approach until a twig cracks underneath your feet.</p><p>\"Oh!\" he says, then relaxes. \"It's you. Actually, just the person I wanted to speak to! Well, really I'd love to speak with whoever engineered these pressure sensors, or better yet who removed them \u2026 they appear to have been worn away shortly before the dam broke and the valley flooded.\"</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear Silaro with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to ask if he needs any more help with his research.</i></p>",
