I'm fine though, don't you worry!\" he cries.</p><p>You help him to his feet and ask about his experiment. \"See I picked up what turned out to be not-so-faint traces of energy still humming through the dam's superstructure, which I believe must have been distributed across the Valley \u2026\" He pauses for a moment, then his eyes widen. \"You wouldn't happen to be heading back to say \u2026 Spire or Branch? Ooo or White Sky, by any chance?\" He smiles sheepishly. \"It's just \u2026 I have another, uh, time sensitive hypothesis to unravel.\"</p></blockquote><p><span color=\"red\">A) Agree to help.</span> Discard all <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> and attach the <mission>HELPING HAND</mission> mission to Silaro.</p><p><span color=\"red\">B) Not today.</span> Discard Silaro.
