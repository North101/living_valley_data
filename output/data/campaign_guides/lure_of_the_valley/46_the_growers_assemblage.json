  "content": "<blockquote id=\"narration_1\"><p>As you approach Meadow's village center, you hear the cheery sounds of commerce. Local foragers and ranchers have set up their daily market, and the people of Meadow have gathered both to trade and to socialize. Stalls of pine and forged carbon bustle with life, their awnings woven from long grasses dyed in a multitude of vibrant colors. Most are stocked with foodstuffs, from freshly baked bread to moss-cherry preserves to smoked mutton. You can see, however, that a few of the locals are trading gear and equipment as well.</p></blockquote>",
