You ask Tala why she is \"formerly\" from the Ice Clans, and she glares and looks away. \"It's because I was exiled,\" she says. \"Now I'm looking for a place to live. You got a problem with me living in your precious Valley?\"</p></blockquote><p color=\"red\">A) No problem whatsoever.</p><blockquote id=\"narration_2\"><p>Despite her harshness, you think you sense a bit of vulnerability in her response. Hesitantly, you suggest that if she is looking for a place to live, you could take her around the Valley and see if any of the villages would be a good fit.</p><p>Tala looks startled at the offer. \"You'd \u2026 help me with that?\" When you assure her that you would, she sets her face back into a stern expression. \"Thanks, then. Let's go.\" You set off, figuring that you'll have to take her to different inhabited locations to see how she feels about each.</p><p>White Sky, Spire, Branch, Meadow, or Tumbledown all seem like good possibilities to you.</p></blockquote><p>Discard all <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon>, and attach the <mission>HELPING HAND</mission> mission to Tala.</p><p><span color=\"red\">A) Leave her in peace.</span> Discard Tala. Each Ranger soothes 2 fatigue.</p>",
