They seemed totally unremarkable, except for a glowing golden mote of light trapped in the center of each. He brings them to his bedroll and pulls out a scanner, running it back and forth across the glass. Eventually, he sits back with a broad grin on his face.</p><p>\"These, I think, are quantumly entangled photons. I don't know how they're suspended in this medium, but the golden sparkles we see aren't the photons themselves. I think they're the photon's quantum 'ghosts.'\"</p><p>He pulls out a pair of circular devices with faces of darkened glass. He flips them over to reveal a square slot. \"Yes, the inscriptions I found said these needed to be powered by entangled photons, but I didn't know what that meant until now.\"</p><p>He plugs a cube into one of the devices. Slowly, long golden lines appear on the dark glass. Though the lines seem random, something about their movement tugs at your mind, like they're trying to tell you something.</p><p>Silaro hands one to you. \"The Estians called them 'probability compasses,' but I'm not sure what they do. Try it out! I'm reasonably sure it's not dangerous.\"</p></blockquote><p>Gain the <reward>Probability Compass</reward> reward card. Complete the <mission>ARCOLOGY ARCHAEOLOGY</mission> mission.</p>",
