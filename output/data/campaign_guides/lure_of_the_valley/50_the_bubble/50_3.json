They seemed totally unremarkable, except for a glowing golden mote of light trapped in the center of each. He brings them to his bedroll and pulls out a scanner, running it back and forth across the glass. Eventually, he sits back with a broad grin on his face.</p><p>\u201cThese, I think, are quantumly entangled photons. I don\u2019t know how they\u2019re suspended in this medium, but the golden sparkles we see aren\u2019t the photons themselves. I think they\u2019re the photon\u2019s quantum \u2018ghosts.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He pulls out a pair of circular devices with faces of darkened glass. He flips them over to reveal a square slot. \u201cYes, the inscriptions I found said these needed to be powered by entangled photons, but I didn\u2019t know what that meant until now.\u201d</p><p>He plugs a cube into one of the devices. Slowly, long golden lines appear on the dark glass. Though the lines seem random, something about their movement tugs at your mind, like they\u2018re trying to tell you something.</p><p>Silaro hands one to you. \u201cThe Estians called them \u2018probability compasses,\u2019 but I\u2019m not sure what they do. Try it out! I\u2019m reasonably sure it\u2019s not dangerous.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Gain the Probability Compass reward card. Complete the <b>ARCOLOGY ARCHAEOLOGY</b> mission.</p>",
