Nestled among the jagged rocks and mud is what looks like a large bubble of trapped air. You see green within and movement as well.</p><p>You ask one of the locals, a young boy, if there's anyone in the Bubble right now. \"Just one,\" he says, not taking his eyes off the bobber on his fishing line. \"Silaro Mako, the archaeologist. Said he wanted to study some of the old arcology gadgets down there.\"</p><p>When you ask when he's coming up, he laughs. \"No idea. Silaro says the Bubble has plenty of food in it. You can stay down there forever.\"</p></blockquote>",
