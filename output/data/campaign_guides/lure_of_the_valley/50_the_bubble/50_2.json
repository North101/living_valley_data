Someone has laid a bedroll next to it, and that same someone is crouched over the disk, studying it intently. The man looks up from his work and waves.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the Bubble! Come over here, why don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Silaro shows you the disk, which appears to be stamped with concentric rings of indecipherable text. He also shows you a translation device he\u2019s built, a glass plate that, when laid over the text, slowly translates parts of it into something legible.</p><p>After a long time enthusiastically talking about his work, Silaro gets a thoughtful look in his eye. \u201cYou know, there are arcology ruins all over the Valley. If you ever find anything interesting, I\u2019d love for you to bring it by and show me. I can give you one of my translation plates too. That might help in any exploration you do.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Gain the <b>ARCOLOGY ARCHAEOLOGY</b> mission.</p><blockquote id=\"narration_2\"><p>\u201cCome back to me to show me what you\u2019ve found. You can find me here, or in Spire, down in the arcology ... or out in the field studying the Fractured Wall. So much to discover! I can\u2019t bear staying in one place for too long.\u201d</p></blockquote>",
