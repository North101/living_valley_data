  "content": "<blockquote><p>The Bubble is just as peaceful as you remember, the thick carpet of moss deadening your footfalls and feeling as soft as a finely woven hammock when you sit down.</p><p>You chat with Silaro about his ongoing translation work for a bit, then settle in to relax and refocus your mind. Your meditation lasts for about an hour, until the small romp of lutrinals that live on the far side of the Bubble think it would be more fun to splash some of the exit pool on you. The resulting water fight between you and a dozen otter-cat hybrids isn\u2019t exactly relaxing, but it does leave you with a smile on your face.</p></blockquote><p>Each Ranger soothes 2 fatigue.</p>",
