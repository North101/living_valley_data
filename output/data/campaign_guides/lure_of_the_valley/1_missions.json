  "content": "<p>To start your campaign, perform the first four steps of setup on page 10 of the rulebook, then return here for the remainder of setup.</p><blockquote id=\"narration_1\"><p>Cresting the gentle, grassy hill, you see the unmistakable silhouette of Lone Tree Station rise out of the highland plains before you. Lone Tree Station is aptly named. The single massive giga-redwood towers above the hills and swaying grass that surround it. You can just make out eaves and balconies among the gnarled bark, doors tucked into the winding roots, and hanging gardens suspended from branches.</p><p>As you draw closer, a woman in a freshly pressed cloak steps out from the main entrance and waves. Calypsa, your mentor for the past nine months, strides toward you with a man who looks just about your age at her heels.</p><p>\u201cHallo!\u201d she calls out. \u201cYou made it. Just look at you!\u201d She clasps your hands, her smile warm and her grip firm. \u201cI\u2019m glad to finally have you here,\u201d she says. Then she turns. \u201cThis is Kal Iver. I trained Kal last year\u2014right before I started training you.\u201d Kal Iver gives you a nod in greeting. \u201cA pleasure,\u201d he says.</p></blockquote><p>Put the Lone Tree Station location into play in the surroundings.</p><blockquote id=\"narration_2\"><p>Calypsa heads back to the station with you and Kal in tow. She speaks back over her shoulder. \u201cPlease, make yourselves at home. Explore the hanging gardens. Find Spirit Speaker Nal and Kordo, and strike up a conversation. Get to know the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter you\u2019ve spent some time here at the Station, you should head over to White Sky,\u201d she says. \u201cIn fact, Hy Pimpot has some juniper biscuits baking right now. His food is legendary around these parts. Once those biscuits are ready and you\u2019ve had a chance to poke around, take a parcel over to White Sky, and offer them to the people you meet. It\u2019s been at least a year since our neighbors have enjoyed the company of Rangers bearing treats.\u201d She turns to look at Kal. \u201cWhat do you think, Kal? Good way to get started?\u201d</p><p>Kal grins at you in a way that you can\u2019t quite describe as a sneer. \u201cHanding out baked goods? I think that\u2019s perfectly suited to their abilities,\u201d he says.</p></blockquote><choice id=\"rangers-choose\">RANGERS CHOOSE:</choice><p color=\"red\">A. Tell Kal what he can do with his condescending attitude.</p><blockquote id=\"narration_3\"><p>Calypsa glares. \u201cRecall the wisdom of our ancestors,\u201d she says. \u201cTreat each other with kindness.\u201d On \u201ckind\u201d she punches you on the shoulder. On \u201c-ness,\u201d she punches Kal\u2019s.</p></blockquote><p>Write <span color=\"blue\">STOOD UP TO KAL</span> on the campaign tracker.</p><p color=\"red\">B. Ignore him.</p><blockquote id=\"narration_4\"><p>Calypsa shakes her head and laughs. \u201cOh, Kal. You\u2019re not long past delivering biscuits yourself. It\u2019s tradition, after all.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Write <span color=\"blue\">IMPRESSED CALYPSA</span> on the campaign tracker.</p><p><b>\u00bb Continue Reading:</b></p><p>Gain the <b>BISCUIT DELIVERY</b> mission. (Add it to the Missions section of the campaign tracker, and put its card into play in the surroundings.)</p><p>Check the campaign tracker for the weather for the current day (day 1). Put the corresponding weather card (A Perfect Day) into play.</p><blockquote id=\"narration_5\"><p>Calypsa turns to you. \u201cKal and I are heading out into the Valley. We\u2019ll be on shadow patrol. That is, we\u2019ll never be too far away from you for the next few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t need our help, of course,\u201d Kal says. \u201cI can tell by looking at you that you\u2019re more than capable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFarewell for now,\u201d Calypsa says and starts down the eastern path away from Lone Tree. \u201cSpirits guide you. Follow your instinct!\u201d She and Kal walk steadily out of sight.</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Explore Lone Tree Station to find Hy Pimpot, retrieve the juniper biscuits, and learn what to do next.</i></p><p>Create the path deck by shuffling together the Woods and Lone Tree card sets (seventeen cards in total). Place it above the surroundings.</p><p>Then, complete all initial setup by performing the setup steps on the back of the Lone Tree Station location card and placing three cloud tokens on the A Perfect Day weather card.</p><p>That concludes setup. You\u2019re ready to play. Now go explore Lone Tree Station, and find Hy Pimpot!</p>",
