You see a flicker of grudging respect. \"I guess you know what you're doing after all.\"</p><p>He thinks for a moment, then grins slyly. \"You think you have what it takes to do something really tough? I hear that if someone goes and spends the night on Greenbriar Knoll, they have the worst nightmares of their life. I knew this one guy. He couldn't stop crying! A spiritspeaker needed to do a lot of work to help him get better.\"</p><p>He raises an eyebrow. \"What about it? I'm game if you are.\"</p></blockquote><p><span color=\"red\">A) All right, Jaris. Let's do this.</span> Discard all <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon>, and attach the <mission>HELPING HAND</mission> mission to Jaris.</p><p><span color=\"red\">B) We don't have time for this.</span> Discard Jaris.
