Then you take out some of the odd gear you\u2019ve collected and demonstrate its use. At that point, a herd of stilt-horses could run over Jaris and he wouldn\u2019t notice.</p><p>After a while, you notice that Jaris\u2019s questions are coming slower, and he seems to be paying less attention. You ask him what is on his mind, and he thinks for a moment. \u201cSo, this is going to sound silly \u2026 but I was thinking. When I was up on Greenbriar Knoll \u2026 well, that was the most scared I\u2019ve ever been in my life. But if I was going to be a Ranger, I need to learn to face my fears, right? So \u2026 would you be willing to go up Greenbriar again with me?\u201d\u201d</p></blockquote><choice id=\"rangers-choose\">Rangers Choose</choice><p><span class=\"text text_red\">A) Why not?</span> Discard all <span><icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon></span>, and attach the <b>HELPING HAND</b> mission to Jaris.</p><p><span class=\"text text_red\">B) Not today.</span> Discard Jaris.
