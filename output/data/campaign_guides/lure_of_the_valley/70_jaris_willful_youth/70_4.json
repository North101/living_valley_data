Then you take out some of the odd gear you've collected and demonstrate its use. At that point, a herd of stilt-horses could run over Jaris and he wouldn't notice.</p><p>After a while, you notice that Jaris's questions are coming slower, and he seems to be paying less attention. You ask him what is on his mind, and he thinks for a moment. \"So, this is going to sound silly \u2026 but I was thinking. When I was up on Greenbriar Knoll \u2026 well, that was the most scared I've ever been in my life. But if I was going to be a Ranger, I need to learn to face my fears, right? So \u2026 would you be willing to go up Greenbriar again with me?\"\"</p></blockquote><p><span color=\"red\">A) Why not?</span> Discard all <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon>, and attach the <mission>HELPING HAND</mission> mission to Jaris.</p><p><span color=\"red\">B) Not today.</span> Discard Jaris. Each Ranger soothes 2 fatigue.</p>",
