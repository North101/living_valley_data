Most importantly, he asks where you've been in the Valley.</p><p>\"I was thinking,\" he says, suddenly bashful. \" ... well, in a few years I'll be old enough to don the cloak, you see. So I was wondering what else it is that the Rangers do?\"</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear Jaris with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to chat with him more about your accomplishments.</i></p>",
