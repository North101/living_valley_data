  "content": "<blockquote><p>You were told the waters of Headwaters Station had magical properties, and when you dive into the deep blue pool, you can see why. The water is cold but not unpleasant, and you feel tingles run down your arms as effervescent bubbles play across your skin.</p><p>As you swim deeper, shapes rise out of the indigo gloom, indistinct forms of animals and people that spin and dive around you. The darkness seems to be illuminated by an expanse of gleaming sand, but as you swim closer, you realize that it\u2019s a field of stars.</p><p>You plunge into the starry expanse, the shapes moving with you and carrying you along. Suddenly, the light grows brighter. You find yourself heading toward a wall of shimmering light\u2014and then you burst through it and erupt out of the water.</p><p>You spend a long time on the edge of the pool, gasping for breath as your lungs clench and burn. But even as your heart thunders in your ears, it feels like your mind has never been clearer.</p></blockquote><p>Gain the Clarity of the Headwaters reward card.</p>",
