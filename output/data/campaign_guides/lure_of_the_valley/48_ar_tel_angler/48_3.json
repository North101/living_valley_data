Perched atop it, an energetic angler casts a high-arcing line into the lake with a tremendously long fishing pole.</p><p>The fisherfolk sees you, then reels in the line and flips the pole around. Thrusting the base of it into the water, the angler pushes off from the ruin and uses the fishing rod to vault to the shore, landing on the trail in front of you.</p><p>\"No need to step lightly. Fishing's been awful lately.
