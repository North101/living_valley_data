You hold the clear pane of glass in front of your eyes, and the words on the walls appear to morph into something legible.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, you find a workshop. The machinery has been carefully powered down, and you are able to activate a small autolathe. After using it to sculpt several useful items out of the nearby bricks of omni-resin, you turn it off again. The only other items of interest are a set of small glass bricks tucked into a corner. Each seems to have motes of golden light trapped in the glass. You tuck them into your rucksack; Silaro may know what they are.</p></blockquote><p>Each Ranger shuffles up to two cards from their discard into their deck.</p>",
