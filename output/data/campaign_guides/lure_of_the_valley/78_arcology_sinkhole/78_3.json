By the time the sun is high overhead, you\u2019ve managed to clear a path to the archway.</p><p>It turns out that the archway leads to a maze of passageways. You explore a little way in but worry about getting lost. The worn print carved into the walls is in a language utterly alien to you and is useless for navigation. Even so, you find a storage locker a few dozen meters down that still has some portable power cells. Their construction is marvelous even after thousands of years, you can still use them to charge your gear.</p><p>Perhaps if you could read the writing on the walls, you might be able to find greater treasures further in? You think you remember someone named Silaro in White Sky who was studying the arcology. Maybe he can help?</p></blockquote><p>Each Ranger can either refill all tokens on a tech card, or search their deck for a tech card, and put it into play.</p>",
