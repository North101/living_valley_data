He unties the artilope leather straps and rolls out the canvas, revealing his collection of found objects. \u201cSee anything you like?\u201d Lunn asks. \u201cInterested in a trade?\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Each Ranger may return a gear from their hand to the collection. If they did, then they choose a starting gear card from the collection that they meet the aspect requirement for and add it to their hand. (This alteration to their deck is permanent.)</p><blockquote><p>Lunn makes a chirping sound to himself as he inspects his newest acquisition. Then he sets it on the canvas, rolls it up, and wanders off into the woods without as much as a goodbye. You hear him whistling a strange, aimless tune as he vanishes among the trees.</p></blockquote>",
