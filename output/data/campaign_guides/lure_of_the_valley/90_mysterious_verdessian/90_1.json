Strangely, it\u2019s standing perfectly still.</p><p>Then you see something moving alongside it. What you thought was a large flowering weed appears to be some sort of being. As you watch, it runs an appendage lightly along the reclaimer\u2019s back, and you see small white flowers sprout from its spine.</p><p>You take a single step, and even that slight movement causes the being\u2019s head to turn in your direction. You\u2019re going to have to approach very cautiously if you don\u2019t want to scare it off.</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear the Verdessian with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to silently observe its behavior.</i></p>",
