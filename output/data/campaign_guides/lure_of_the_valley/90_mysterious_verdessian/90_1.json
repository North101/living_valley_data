Strangely, it's standing perfectly still.</p><p>Then you see something moving alongside it. What you thought was a large flowering weed appears to be some sort of being. As you watch, it runs an appendage lightly along the reclaimer's back, and you see small white flowers sprout from its spine.</p><p>You take a single step, and even that slight movement causes the being's head to turn in your direction. You're going to have to approach very cautiously if you don't want to scare it off.</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear the Verdessian with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to silently observe its behavior.</i></p>",
