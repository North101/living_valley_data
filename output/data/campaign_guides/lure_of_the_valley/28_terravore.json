  "content": "<blockquote id=\"narration_1\"><p>From far away, it looks like a massive molehill winding through valleys and over ridge lines, a ridge of rocky ground cutting through the trees. Only as you get closer can you make out the incongruous details: the regular height and width of the ridge: the occasional vents oozing steam into the still air, and the gaping cavern where the ridge finally terminates in a glen.</p><p>As you get closer, you can see how the land\u2014bushes, trees, rocks, and dirt\u2014looks like it\u2019s been scooped into that maw-like cavern. Then the entire \"ridge\" shudders and slides forward, and a few more inches of land are shoveled into the maw. The entire ridge is one of the legendary terravores, a kilometers-long biomeld that slowly but inevitably consumes and processes everything in its path.</p></blockquote>",
