She sprints down to the shore, and as you follow, you find her poking happily at a massive, partially submerged tree, felled near the basin's edge.</p><p>\"Take a look at this,\" she crows. \"Dolewood!\" She raps it, and you hear a solid thunk. \"You couldn't ask for better conditions. The bark is still perfect, and all this rot just makes it easier to clean out!\"</p></blockquote><p>Search the path deck for a Rotting Dolewood, and put it into play.</p><blockquote id=\"narration_2\"><p>Lyn lays out several tools and readies her saw. The energy blade flickers and comes to life. She gestures toward her tools. \"Instead of standing around, why don't you take one of these and help? Finishing this canoe will go a lot faster with multiple hands!\"</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear Lyn with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to complete the canoe.</i></p>",
