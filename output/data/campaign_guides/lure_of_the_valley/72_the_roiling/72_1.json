Then, with a start, you realize the \"rocks\" and \"logs\" are too smooth and too evenly shaped to be natural. One shifts beneath your hand, and suddenly you realize you've been climbing around and through the tangled coils of many hydraworms.</p><p>As they begin to writhe around you, a mass of worm bodies begins to rise out of the swamp. The worm knot looks like its formed of dozens of hydraworms. This goliath is too large to be anything but the Roiling, the oldest and nastiest hydraworm in the Valley.</p></blockquote>",
