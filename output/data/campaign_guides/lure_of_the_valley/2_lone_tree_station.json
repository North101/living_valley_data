  "content": "<blockquote><p>Visible for miles around, Lone Tree is a single enormous giga-redwood rising out of the thick grass of a high prairie. From far away, the tree is all you can see, but as you come closer, you can see the rest of the station: the large box-garden plots hanging from the branches, the airship Swift moored to its dock in the tree\u2019s crown, the doors and windows carved into the trunk and peeking out from among the roots. Lone Tree Station has been the base of operations for the Rangers ever since the people came to the Valley. And ever since you became a Ranger, it\u2019s been your home.</p></blockquote>",
