  "content": "<blockquote id=\"narration_1\"><p>Rising up from a series of small hillocks along the edges of Meadow's vast prairie, the large towers each support a massive loop of dull-gray metal and ceramics. Some have broken into half- or quarter-circles, but a few are still intact. The locals in Meadow say that if you go to the edges of the Valley with a scope and look back through all the loops at once, you'll see another world in a reality just sideways from your own. Almost every artificer who's inspected the rings, however, believes they are part of a vast (and nonfunctional) sensor network.</p></blockquote>",
