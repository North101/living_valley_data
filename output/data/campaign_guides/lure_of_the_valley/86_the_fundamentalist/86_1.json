You\u2019ve heard Tykor lives alone and often wanders the Valley, but here in the verdant stone bowl, he seems to have set up a quiet meditation spot in the greenery. Tykor himself is sitting cross-legged on a large boulder with what appears to be an offering of fruits, flowers, and fragrant tea set out before him. His eyes are closed, and you can hear him mumbling to himself.</p><p>When you get close, he seems to hear you because he opens his eyes. You ask him what he\u2019s doing, and he stares back at you for a long moment. \u201cSpeaking with my parents,\u201d he says finally. \u201cWhat brings you to the Bowl of the Sun?\u201d</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear the Fundamentalist with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to ask him about his way of life.</i></p>",
