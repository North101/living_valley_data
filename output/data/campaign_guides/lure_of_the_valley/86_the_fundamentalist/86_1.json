  "content": "<blockquote id=\"narration_1\"><p>As you descend into a warm patch of sun, you see Tykor Hum, the so-called Fundamentalist of the Valley. You've heard Tykor lives alone and often wanders the Valley, but here in the verdant stone bowl, he seems to have set up a quiet meditation spot in the greenery. Tykor himself is sitting cross-legged on a large boulder with what appears to be an offering of fruits, flowers, and fragrant tea set out before him. His eyes are closed, and you can hear him mumbling to himself.</p><p>When you get close, he seems to hear you because he opens his eyes. You ask him what he's doing, and he stares back at you for a long moment. \"Speaking with my parents,\" he says finally. \"What brings you to the Bowl of the Sun?\"</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear the Fundamentalist with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to ask him about his way of life.</i></p>",
