That's just us imposing our will on the rest of the world, which we have no more right to do than any other animal.\"</p><p>You ask if human's sapience changes the situation at all, and he waves his hands as if driving off a fly. \"You sound like all the rest. No, no, our sapience just means we should recognize our capacity to change the world, and then make the conscious choice to reject that.\"</p><p>As he talks, he starts to pack his things. In a minute, he is ready to leave. Unless you ask him to stay, he is clearly going to head out.</p></blockquote><p><span color=\"red\">A) Have him stay and continue helping you.</span> Discard all <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> from the Fundamentalist, and move him.</p><p><span color=\"red\">B) Say goodbye.</span> Discard the Fundamentalist.
