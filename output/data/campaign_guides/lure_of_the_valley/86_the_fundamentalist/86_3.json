Then you ask the question on your mind; are the reclaimers a natural part of the environment that should be left alone, or a human creation that should be removed?</p><p>Tykor strokes his grizzled chin and stares into space for a while. \"That's a good question,\" he says finally. \"On the one hand, these reclaimers of yours are clearly biomelds, created by our ancestors for Guide knows what reason. You could argue that removing them is no different than disassembling one of your villages so that everyone can live a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. In fact, you could even argue that removing them is just cleaning up our ancestors' mess.\"</p><p>\"But,\" he continues, raising a finger, \"Humans have been a part of the ecosystem for hundreds of thousands of years. This whole ecosystem,\" he gestures to the Valley and the world beyond with wild sweeps of his hands, \"is created by humans. First we changed it with our actions thousands of years ago, then we changed it again with the Generational Projects trying to change the first change!\"</p><p>He laughs for a moment, then grows serious. \"Perhaps the only thing we can do is to resolve to step back from this point forward, and stop meddling. That's what I'd suggest, at any rate. Stop meddling, because it always leads to more meddling.\" But then you hear his voice quiver just a tiny bit. \"But \u2026 I suppose that's a cold comfort to all the people those reclaimers might hurt. That it's \u2026 natural.\"</p><p>Tykor suddenly stands and begins to pack his bags without another word. In a minute, he is ready to leave with his rucksack. Unless you ask him to stay, he is clearly going to head out.</p></blockquote><p><span color=\"red\">A) Have him stay and continue helping you.</span> Discard all <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> from the Fundamentalist, and move him.</p><p><span color=\"red\">B) Say goodbye.</span> Discard the Fundamentalist. Each Ranger soothes 2 fatigue.</p>",
