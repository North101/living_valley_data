  "content": "<blockquote><p>Climbing the spurs of Mount Nim is tiring work. A brisk wind chills your skin. As you approach the summit, you look out and see almost the entirety of the Valley stretching to the south. White Sky Lake glimmers below, then, following the thread of the Silverfin River, you can spot the thin, gleaming spike of Spire in the distance. Beyond, you imagine you can see the mouth of the Valley, where the ground drops away into the emerald expanse of the Verdessa below.</p></blockquote>",
