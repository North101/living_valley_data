Could always talk to him.\"</p><p>She thinks for a moment. \"By the by, if you're planning on spending some time in these parts, I'd find a few stilt-horses. Best way to navigate these grasslands.\"</p><p><b>If you are on REMOVE THE RECLAIMERS:</b> \"And you're still looking for a solution to the reclaimers, no? Well Kasende down in Tumbledown is the best hunter I know. And that shaper girl up in Spire, what's her name? Day? Dace? I bet she could help you get a good eagle-eyed view with all that climbing and swooping she does.\"</p></blockquote>",
