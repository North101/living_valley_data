  "content": "<blockquote><p>As you make your way across a long narrow bridge suspended among the upper branches of the forest, the din of a crowd draws your eyes to a stout wooden hall ahead. Fir needles cover its exterior, crisscrossing to create a tapestry reaching up and around the dolewood\u2019s upper branches.</p><p>Its ornate door swings open to reveal a meeting hall, with different gathering platforms winding down the sides of the trunk. On every floor you see villagers drinking, reading, and talking of all the comings and goings of the Valley. The scent of sweet ale washes over you. Near the entrance, a map of the Valley hangs on a wall next to a board covered with handwritten messages and notices.</p></blockquote>",
