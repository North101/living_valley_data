  "content": "<blockquote><p>The grasses in this part of the Valley rise so tall that you don\u2019t realize you\u2019ve reached Meadow until the path suddenly opens, revealing several humble cottages centered around the stump of a fallen dolewood.</p><p>The normally sleepy clearing is full of excited, chattering people. Lively music fills the air. Children run between the legs of the milling adults, playing tag. A set of tables have been dragged out into the center of the field and are already groaning under the weight of dishes of fragrant food. Beyond that, you hear uproarious cheering coming from a swirling circle of dancing villagers, spinning from partner to partner in an exuberant display.</p></blockquote><p>Do not perform the usual setup for Meadow, and do not draw a path card on the first round in Meadow. Search the General set for Dancers Round, and put it into play. Search the Valley set for Ol\u2019 Bloody Clicker, and shuffle him into to the path deck. Then each Ranger chooses a dancing partner by searching the collection for a human and putting them into play within reach with their <icon icon=\"ranger_token\">&nbsp;</icon> on them.</p>",
