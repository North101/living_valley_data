  "content": "<blockquote id=\"narration_1\"><p>Krishtu Meeks explains that if you want to learn more about the arcology, Silaro is the person to talk to. You sigh and set off into the darkness.</p><p>The pitch-black passages quickly become a labyrinthine maze, with the shadows easily swallowing up the meager lights you brought with you. But eventually, you see a glimmering light up ahead. You race forward to find Silaro crouched next to a set of lamps that give off a warm, flickering glow. He's studying long strings of writing that appear to have been stamped into the walls, but looks up when you approach. \"Ah, hello!\" he says. \"Don't get many visitors down here; what can I do for you?\"</p><p>You explain that you're interested in the people who built this arcology, and Silaro gets a gleam in his eyes. \"Ah, the Estians,\" he says with a smile. \"They're a fascinating bunch, to be sure. I've been studying them my entire life, and I've only scratched the surface of what I can learn.\"</p><p>\"Tell you what,\" he says. \"The best way to learn is by doing, I always say. So why don't you poke around the various ruins scattered through the Valley. If you find anything interesting, bring it back, and I'll see what I can tell you about it. And I'll share what I know of the Estians as well.\"</p></blockquote><p>Gain the <mission>ARCOLOGY ARCHAEOLOGY</mission> mission.</p><blockquote id=\"narration_2\"><p>\"I also commonly work out of the Bubble beneath White Sky or out in the field at the Fractured Wall, so please stop in if you're in the area!\"</p></blockquote>",
