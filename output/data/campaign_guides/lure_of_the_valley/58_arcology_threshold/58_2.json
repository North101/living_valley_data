You sigh and set off into the darkness.</p><p>The pitch-black passages quickly become a labyrinthine maze, with the shadows easily swallowing up the meager lights you brought with you. But eventually, you see a glimmering light up ahead. You race forward to find Silaro crouched next to a set of lamps that give off a warm, flickering glow. He\u2019s studying long strings of writing that appear to have been stamped into the walls, but looks up when you approach. \u201cAh, hello!\u201d he says. \u201cDon\u2019t get many visitors down here; what can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>You explain that you\u2019re interested in the people who built this arcology, and Silaro gets a gleam in his eyes. \u201cAh, the Estians,\u201d he says with a smile. \u201cThey\u2019re a fascinating bunch, to be sure. I\u2019ve been studying them my entire life, and I\u2019ve only scratched the surface of what I can learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you what,\u201d he says. \u201cThe best way to learn is by doing, I always say. So why don\u2019t you poke around the various ruins scattered through the Valley. If you find anything interesting, bring it back, and I\u2019ll see what I can tell you about it. And I\u2019ll share what I know of the Estians as well.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Gain the <b>ARCOLOGY ARCHAEOLOGY</b> mission.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI also commonly work out of the Bubble beneath White Sky or out in the field at the Fractured Wall, so please stop in if you\u2019re in the area!\u201d</p></blockquote>",
