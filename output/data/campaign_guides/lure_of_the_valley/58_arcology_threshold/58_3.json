He looks up from another etching in the wall and grins when he sees you. \u201cMy friends!\u201d he calls. \u201cGood to see you as always. Quickly, come here and look at this!\u201d</p><p>You crouch down next to him and see that he has been scraping away lichen from what appears to be sets of lines stamped all across the metal. \u201cI think this is a map!\u201d Silaro exclaims. \u201cIf I\u2019m right, this arcology goes much deeper than any of us assumed. It\u2019s spread out much further too! All through the Valley, and maybe even out into the Verdessa!\u201d</p><p>You tell Silaro about your own investigations, and he excitedly compares your notes to his map. \u201cIndeed, indeed!\u201d he shouts. \u201cThanks to your observations, I think I can orient myself to this map. It appears you\u2019re right \u2026 the arcology does reach out to the Verdessa. See this route here? It reaches all the way out into that huge forest. There must be something there \u2026 too bad the route is far deeper than we\u2019ve ever traveled in these ruins.\u201d</p><p>He thinks for a long moment. \u201cBut what makes me even more curious is the evidence that they were gone long before the floods. I always assumed the floods wiped them out, but if they were already gone, then\u2026well, clearly the dam failed because of their long absence, so they must have left decades or even centuries before. \u201cI can tell you one thing, though. They didn\u2019t travel overland; there\u2019s no evidence of them leaving through the northern passes. Honestly, there\u2019s no evidence that they migrated from this place at all. So \u2026 what happened to them?\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Each Ranger soothes 2 fatigue.</p>",
