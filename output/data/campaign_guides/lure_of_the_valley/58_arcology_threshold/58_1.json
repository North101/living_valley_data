  "content": "<blockquote id=\"narration_1\"><p>Most everyone in the Valley (and certainly everyone in Spire) is familiar with the arcology, but most of them think of the upper levels that have become the basements and power generation stations of Spire. You head past the water turbines and the enclosed river docks, down into a level below the Silverfin. Here the air is a bit damp, but you find yourself in a brightly lit chamber full of cabinets and pedestals. Artifacts are scattered throughout the space, each with a neat label identifying them. Most seem to be from the Estians. Some seem even older, from the decades before the Guide led people to begin the Generational Projects.</p><p>A mousy young woman with large glowing glasses scurries up, introducing herself as Krishtu Meeks. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for Silaro,\u201d she says, \u201che\u2019s deeper into the arcology tunnels.\u201d She points to a series of vaulted entrances leading off from the chamber. Each seems darker and more oppressive than the last.</p><p>Krishtu sees your hesitation. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she says. \u201cIt should be safe \u2026 we haven\u2019t seen anything dangerous in the upper passages for \u2026 months now.\u201d</p></blockquote>",
