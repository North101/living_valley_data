  "content": "<blockquote id=\"narration_1\"><p>Kordo told you that when the Rangers first explored the Valley, they set up outposts every few kilometers. They had deliberately placed some in the most inhospitable locations, assuming that would be where they would be needed the most.</p><p>Pushing aside another curtain of moss and cobwebs, you see one of those forlorn outposts before you. The building has sunk deep into the swamp. Between the grime-caked walls and the hydraworms that seem to be inhabiting it, it's clear that no Ranger has visited this outpost in quite some time.</p></blockquote>",
