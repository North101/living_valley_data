The blighter may fly all over the Valley, but she likes perching at the top of the Spire, then swooping down to snatch up her prey. Last year, it was Old Harli Jephson. I don't want to see that happen again.\"</p></blockquote><p><span color=\"red\">A) Agree to help.</span> Gain the <mission>LURE (UMBRA)</mission> mission. Reminder: find Umbra and attach her to the mission card. You may choose this option only if you don't have another Lure or Confront mission. Discard Elder Orlin.</p><p><span color=\"red\">B) Not today.</span> Discard Elder Orlin. Each Ranger soothes 2 fatigue.</p>",
