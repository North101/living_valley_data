Then she blows out a cloud of astringent, purple smoke. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking to help people, I know Dace, one of the shapers, just down from the Monastery. She\u2019s been struggling with her training. And I heard that Tollin Lang may need some help with some fool art installation down south. Otherwise, the archaeologist, Silaro, he\u2019s always poking around near the arcology threshold.\u201d</p><p>She takes another puff. \u201cIf none of those appeal, head over to the Hearty Brew, and ask around. Otherwise, you can always stop by the Carbon Forge if you're in need of some gear.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>If you are on REMOVE THE RECLAIMERS:</b> Elder Orlin stops as a thought occurs to her. \"That all seems like small sunberries at this point. Do you have any updates on the reclaimers?\" You explain that you're looking for answers, and she rubs her temple thoughtfully. \"In a village as large as this, I'm sure that someone here could help. Maybe that shaper, Dace. She knows a thing or two.\"</p></blockquote>",
