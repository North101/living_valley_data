It's time to flood the reclaimer nest and rid the Valley of them once and for all.</p><p>\"I meditated through the night,\" Aell says. \"We will summon a storm the likes of which has not been seen in the Valley for a thousand years!\"</p><p>He carefully unwraps what appears to be a long wooden cylinder, woven through with delicate copper wire. He picks it up, and it makes a hissing sound like a far-off deluge. The hairs on your arms start to rise as he begins to channel through the conduit, and you can feel the humidity rise and the wind pick up.</p><p>\"Position yourself upstream,\" he says. \"It may take hours for the flooding to begin. Once it does, you're going to need to direct the flow of water for maximum effect. You can use trees, dig ditches, or even collapse ruins, but just make sure it's done. Otherwise this whole place may be washed away or we may miss the nest entirely!\"</p><p>Aell adjusts his hat and flashes a confident smile. \"Just let me know if you need assistance. And keep those reclaimers off of me!\" With that, he raises his conduit, and the skies instantly darken.</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear Aell with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to move a Flood card.</i></p><p>Replace the current weather with Downpour (if it is not already in play).</p><p>Search the Marsh of Rebirth set for Aell, Ambitious Shaper, and put him into play within reach of a Ranger of your choice. Do not read his entry. Search the General set for all Reclaimers, and shuffle them into the path deck.</p><p>Finally, after you have completed arrival setup, search the General set for one Flood, and put it into play.</p>",
