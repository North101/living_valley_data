There you settle down to enjoy your supper as you enjoy the sight of the Valley spread out beneath you, bathed in the golden glow of the setting sun. You bask in the knowledge that you\u2019ve traveled across the Valley, helping everyone who needed aid and exploring every secluded glen and rushing brook. You\u2019re sure that tomorrow there will be new tasks ahead, but you can rest easy \u2026 for now.</p></blockquote><p>Complete the <b>THE VALLEY\u2019S SECRETS</b> mission, and gain the Connectedness of All Things reward card.</p><p>Your story will continue, but for now, you must rest. You have fully completed the <b><i>Lure of the Valley</i></b> campaign. Thank you for spending so much time with <b><i>Earthborne Rangers!</i></b> We love you!</p>",
