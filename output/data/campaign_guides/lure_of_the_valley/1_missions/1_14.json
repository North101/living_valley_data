Quit snacking; we\u2019ve got a ride ahead of us!\u201d</p><p>You spend a few hours at the biological station resting after your hike, while Sirisana continues her studies. As the light is starting to fade, Sirisana\u2019s apprentice, Tiella Jakarra, returns from a day of field studies with a rucksack full of lichen and an armful of branches for the fire pit. Sirisana gets her up to speed on events, and the two immediately fall into a lively debate about what, if anything, to do about the reclaimers.</p><p>\u201cThey are clearly an invasive species,\u201d Sirisana says. \u201cThere is no prior record of these biomelds in the Valley. Our ancestors encountered these reclaimers in the time before we settled here, but that was long ago. They're yet another biomeld run amok, fulfilling some esoteric purpose that's at odds with the natural world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know that for certain,\u201d Tiella retorts. \u201cEven if they are fulfilling some outmoded purpose, they\u2019ve had centuries to become part of the ecosystem! Look at the relgarbeasts! They were once viewed as an invasive pest, but over time we've learned how critical they are to the ecology of the Verdessa! Or take growling weevils\u2014\u201d</p><p>At this point, you hesitantly interrupt to point out that what these beings are may matter less than why they have suddenly arrived and whether or not anything can be done about it. Both Sirisana and Tiella stare at you, like the idea never occurred to them.</p></blockquote><highlight highlight=\"blue\">IF THE RANGERS HAVE <span color=\"blue\">BEFRIENDED THE VERDESSIAN</span>, GO TO <a href=\"#114a\">1.14A</a>.</highlight><br /><p><b>OTHERWISE, READ:</b></p><blockquote id=\"narration_2\"><p>\u201cThey must have a nest,\u201d Tiella says. \u201cSomewhere they congregate. To learn more, you\u2019re going to have to find it. Maybe you could tag the reclaimers and then follow the tagged ones back to their nest?\u201d</p><p>You agree, and Tiella and Sirisana spend the next hour rigging up a simple tagging system; small, sticky balls of sap treated with a particularly pungent substance. Then they hand you a small cage full of wood shavings; in the center of which is a drowsy looking mole with a long pink muzzle.</p><p>\u201cBecher\u2019s mole,\u201d Tiella explains. She reaches into the cage and pulls out the mole, who yawns sleepily. Then she wafts some of the pungent aroma under its nose, and the mole suddenly perks up and starts yipping shrilly. \u201cOne whiff of this mole sow musk, and Gus will follow it to the ends of the earth. He can smell it from up to two kilometers away!\u201d</p><p>You leave with the mole and the sap tags, but only after making a promise that you\u2019ll do your best to return Gus safe and sound once this is all over.</p></blockquote><p>Complete the <b>JOURNEY (BIOLOGICAL OUTPOST)</b> mission, and gain the <b>FIND THE NEST</b> mission.</p><h2 id=\"114a\">1.14A</h2><blockquote id=\"narration_3\"><p>\u201cThey must have a nest,\u201d Tiella says. \u201cSomewhere they congregate.
