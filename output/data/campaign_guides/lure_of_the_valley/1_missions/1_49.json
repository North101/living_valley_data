It\u2019s not just tunnels and passages running throughout the Valley, but living quarters and vast underground halls. The arcology is massive, and it makes you consider just what the Estians were capable of.</p></blockquote><span color=\"red\">B) \u2666\u2666\u2662</span><blockquote><p>You had always assumed that the Estians died off when the great megadam to the north ruptured and flooded the Valley. But the more you explore, the more you believe that wasn\u2019t the case. The Estians vanished long before the dam shattered, and you can\u2019t find any reason why.</p></blockquote><span color=\"red\">C) \u2666\u2666\u2666</span><blockquote><p>Based on the evidence you\u2019ve found, you\u2019ve determined the Estians were not just skilled architects and builders but brilliant scientists as well. Many of the structures on the surface seemed to be research stations and observation posts. You keep noticing references to the Verdessa in regards to some major project. Whatever the Estians were up to, it seems to involve the Verdessa. This is worth bringing to Silaro, so you\u2019d better find him again.</p></blockquote>",
