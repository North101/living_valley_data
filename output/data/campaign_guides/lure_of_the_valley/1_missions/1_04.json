Rain is falling on the head of the Valley in thick sheets, and the creek near your camp has spilled over its banks.</p><p>Before you finish packing, a familiar figure approaches your camp. It\u2019s Kal Iver. \u201cMake haste!\u201d he calls. \u201cAreas southeast of Lone Tree are flooding! It was that ridiculous shaper! Came to water the hanging gardens and instead created an entire storm front! Elder Thrush is sending teams across the upper Valley for rescue and relief efforts. You must go to White Sky, Kobo\u2019s Market, and to the Golden Shore, if you can get there in time. Make sure everyone is safe, then provide whatever aid you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis could have been avoided,\u201d Kal says, mostly to himself. He looks down the trail in the direction of Lone Tree, then back to you. \u201cI would accompany you, but Calypsa and I have been tasked with finding Aell. Maybe he can fix the mess that he\u2019s created and put a stop to this rain. You\u2019re on your own. Good luck! You\u2019re going to need it!\u201d</p><p>As if on cue, a peal of thunder rattles the air.</p></blockquote><p>Gain the <b>RISING WATERS</b> mission. You will have to move fast to beat the waters.
