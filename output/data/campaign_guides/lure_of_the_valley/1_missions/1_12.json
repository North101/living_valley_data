Soon the rest will leave the nest, and when they do, they'll head to Spire.\u201d</p></blockquote><choice id=\"rangers-choose-3\">RANGERS CHOOSE</choice><p color=\"red\">A) Why are you attacking Spire?</p><blockquote><p>Nal flinches. \u201cIt's very agitated. It's not attacking, it says. No attack. Only destruction. It believes that there is something underneath Spire.

But eventually, you think you understand.
