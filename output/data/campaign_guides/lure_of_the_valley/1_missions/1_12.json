But eventually, you think you understand. The Verdessian has no quarrel with the Valley and its inhabitants, but something buried deep within the arcology below Spire threatens the Verdessian and its kin. It hoped that the reclaimers would consume Spire and the arcology beneath and thus end the threat.</p><p>You spend an even longer time trying to convey the idea that Spire is also a sizable community full of people, even if there is an ancient arcology beneath it. They will be endangered when the reclaimers arrive. Perhaps, you suggest, there is another way to save the Verdessians, and you could help discover it \u2026 once the reclaimer threat has been addressed.</p><p>\"I see a clear image of the Spire overrun with reclaimers,\" Nal says. \"It is too late to change course. The Verdessian has convinced itself that this is the only way to save its people.\" \"But I see something else: a collection of Estian ruins ... climbing vines ... a river. There, reclaimers gather in great numbers. A nest.
