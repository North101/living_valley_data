They always come bearing treats!\u201d Hy Pimpot winks and takes a biscuit for himself.</p><p>You shoulder the basket and walk down the trail. As you do, the enticing aroma of the biscuits wafts up from the basket. You remember that you haven\u2019t eaten anything since breakfast. Your stomach growls. Surely they won\u2019t miss one or two.</p></blockquote><p>Flip the <b>BISCUIT DELIVERY</b> mission to the <b>BISCUIT BASKET</b> side. Then choose a Ranger to equip it.</p>",
