Before long, a man wearing many layers of cloaks and walking with the aid of an ornate conduit follows. As he passes, he tips his wide-brimmed hat in your direction.</p><p>\"Good day to you, friends!\"</p><p>\"Good day, Master Aell,\" Calypsa replies. \"Lone Tree's hanging gardens are thirsty. They'll be grateful for some rain.\"</p><p>\"Fear not, my dear Calypsa! For there is no shaper more skilled at stirring the clouds than I. By the time you return, those gardens will be thoroughly soaked!\"</p><p>With that, the shaper continues down the path. He resumes his whistling as he passes from sight.</p><p>Kal shakes his head. \"That fool is overly impressed by his own abilities,\" he says. \"Trouble will come of it. Mark my words.\"</p><p>Calypsa nods then turns to you. \"It's time you should be on your way,\" she says. \"The village elders often have tasks that require the help of the Rangers. I recommend that you seek them out on your travels. I know also that Kordo would like some help dealing with the caustic mulcher that roams the woodlands. I'm not sure what he has in mind, but you can seek him out at Lone Tree Station if you're interested. Farewell!\"</p><p>With that, Calypsa and Kal disappear into the forest, leaving you to explore the Valley on your own.</p></blockquote><p>What you do now is entirely up to you. You could, for example, spend time exploring the different path types to familiarize yourself with the flora and fauna, or you could travel to pivotal locations on the map and delve into the path deck to find people in need of assistance and missions to complete. Take your time. You will be called upon if there's an emergency. Now, you may end the day or continue playing. If you end the day, you are considered to have camped.</p>",
