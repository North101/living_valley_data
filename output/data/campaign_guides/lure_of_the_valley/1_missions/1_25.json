We'll have to stick around here long enough to make sure it's working, and it could get pretty dangerous. Do you want to begin now? Or do you need some time to rest?\"</p></blockquote><p color=\"red\">A) Camp and start fresh tomorrow (ends the day).</p><blockquote id=\"narration_2\"><p>The Marsh of Rebirth is a terrible place to camp, but Kasende helps you string hammocks several meters above the water. She also calmly recommends you strap yourself into your hammock so you don't fall out in the night and become a meal for a lucky hydraworm. With that comforting thought, you settle down for the night.</p></blockquote><p>Complete the <mission>JOURNEY (MARSH OF REBIRTH)</mission> mission, and gain the <mission>GRUESOME FEAST</mission> mission.

You head into the murky and mist-filled heart of the Marsh, finding a spit of relatively dry ground to stand on. Then Kasende activates the lure. Almost immediately, you hear the scuttling, splashing sounds of hundreds of reclaimers heading toward you. Kasende sucks in a slow breath and raises her whispercrack darter. \"We need enough of them here to drive the hydraworms into a feeding frenzy. Until then \u2026 we just have to survive.\"</p></blockquote><p>Complete the <mission>JOURNEY (MARSH OF REBIRTH)</mission> mission, and gain the <mission>GRUESOME FEAST</mission> mission.</p><p>Search the Tumbledown set for Kasende, Expert Hunter, and put her into play within reach of a Ranger of your choice.
