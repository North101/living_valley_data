The floodwaters have been diverted, and you've saved the area around White Sky Lake from the worst of it.</p><p>You decide to take a much needed nap, only to wake up to an impromptu party. A number of the locals have gathered with food and drink, and you end up spending most of the afternoon celebrating. Your revelry is interrupted when a man runs up to you and breathlessly says, \"You need to come and see this!\"</p></blockquote><p>Complete the <mission>RISING WATERS</mission> mission.

Calypsa and Kal Iver are there as well, speaking quietly to one another. Among the debris, there is a startling sight: dozens of strange corpses, deposited here by the flood. The corpses are battered, broken, and caked in filth, but they are all clearly one species\u2014a biomeld, and unlike anything any of you have ever seen. You see pale flesh, eyeless faces, and long limbs ending in claws.</p><p>Calypsa approaches you with a haunted look on her face. \"Kal and I are going to help clean up this mess. What are they? And where did they come from?\" She places her hand on your shoulder. \"Bring word of this to Elder Orlin in Spire. If anyone in the Valley knows what these things are, it's her.\"</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Travel to Spire to speak with Elder Orlin and offer what help you can within the next four days.</i></p><p>Gain the <mission>JOURNEY (SPIRE)</mission> mission.
