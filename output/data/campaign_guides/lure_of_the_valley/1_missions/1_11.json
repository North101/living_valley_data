Soon it starts to parallel a set of reclaimer tracks. Interesting. Why is the Verdessian following the reclaimers?</p></blockquote><p color=\"red\">B) \u2666\u2666\u2662</p><blockquote id=\"narration_3\"><p>You find the Verdessian in a clearing, again standing beside a docile reclaimer with small white flowers growing out of its back. You watch as the reclaimer slinks away, and the Verdessian slowly turns to face you when suddenly, it seems to melt into the earth! You rush into the clearing, but the Verdessian is gone. You do, however, find several dart-like thorns in the grass. They drip with some sort of goo that, when you take a whiff, causes your senses to reel. You suspect it's a powerful soporific, and maybe how the Verdessian captures the reclaimers. But what is it doing with them? You'll have to pick up its trail again to learn more.</p></blockquote><p color=\"red\">C) \u2666\u2666\u2666</p><blockquote id=\"narration_4\"><p>The trail leads to the top of a butte, and when you peer around a fallen tree, you find the Verdessian standing next to another reclaimer which has small white flowers growing out of its spine. As you watch, the Verdessian gestures, and the reclaimer slithers away, seemingly at the Verdessian's command.</p><p>You notice that the ground beneath the Verdessian's \"feet\" is solid rock. It may not be able to escape into the ground here as it did before.</p></blockquote><p>Complete the <mission>TRAIL OF VINES</mission> mission. Each Ranger soothes 2 fatigue.</p><blockquote id=\"narration_5\"><p>You emerge from behind the fallen tree. As before, the Verdessian spots you and tries to melt into the ground. But the rocks at its feet prove impenetrable, and instead of vanishing, the Verdessian collapses into a tangled ball of roots, vines, and leaves. You realize this is your chance! You dash forward and carefully scoop the ball into one of your heavy haversacks. The Verdessian squirms inside the sack as a vine pokes out of the top.</p><p>You sit, panting for a moment, trying to decide what to do. After some thought, you decide that if anyone is going to be able to communicate with the Verdessian, it's Spirit Speaker Nal.</p><p>Almost instantly you feel Nal's presence\u2014like she's been with you this entire time. Then images come into your mind as if emerging from a dark pool: a towering waterfall, a sheer cliff, and a vast jungle. You recognize it as the view from Tumbledown. Nal wants you to bring the Verdessian to Tumbledown. Somehow, you know that she'll meet you there.</p></blockquote><p>Gain the <mission>DEEPER MOTIVES</mission> mission.
