Quiet hisses at you, baring her fangs, but doesn\u2019t flinch or snap at you as you reach your hand to her nose. She sniffs, cautiously, and then to your surprise and amazement, she leans forward and gives you an affectionate head rub that sends you tumbling over on your backside.</p><p>Quiet starts to purr quietly, and you feel a warmth steal through your soul at the sound, as if you have some sort of deeper connection with her. You\u2019re not sure how you know, but you\u2019re convinced she won\u2019t come after anyone in the nearby villages now. She seems a lot more interested in you, so she might keep a wary eye on you from afar, and perhaps help you when you need aid.</p></blockquote><p>Complete the<b> LURE (QUIET)</b> mission. Permanently remove Quiet from the Valley set. Gain the Quiet reward card. Each Ranger soothes 2 fatigue.</p><h1 id=\"143b\">1.43B</h1><blockquote><p>Bruised, buffeted, but undaunted, you slowly approach the head of the massive bird. Umbra's eyes watch carefully as you reach under her chin and scratch the ruffled feathers there. The raptor doesn\u2019t move at first, but after a long moment, she stretches out her huge wings and envelops you in them.</p><p>In the warm darkness beneath her wings, you know you should be afraid but you actually feel safe and comforted. You\u2019re not sure how you know, but you\u2019re convinced Umbra won\u2019t come after anyone in the nearby villages now. She seems almost protective and nurturing of you, so she might keep a concerned eye on you from afar, and perhaps help you when you need aid.</p></blockquote><p>Complete the <b>LURE (UMBRA)</b> mission.

You see yourself reflected in Ol\u2019 Bloody Clicker\u2019s multifaceted eyes as his head angles down to look at you, and you try not to flinch as his long, feathery feelers run delicately across your face and body.</p><p>After a long moment, Ol\u2019 Bloody Clicker retreats to the mouth of his tunnel and there watches you with a singular focus. You\u2019re not sure how you know, but you\u2019re convinced Ol\u2019 Bloody Clicker won\u2019t come after anyone in the nearby villages now. He seems to respect that this is your territory, so he leaves to hunt elsewhere.</p></blockquote><p>Complete the <b>LURE (OL\u2019 BLOODY CLICKER)</b> mission.
