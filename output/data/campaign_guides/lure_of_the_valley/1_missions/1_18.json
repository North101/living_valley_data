Ben Amon steps out and waves, followed by Kordo and Elder Thrush.</p><p>Thrush comes striding across the green. Kordo, a grim expression on his face, stands nearby with a long-barreled whispercrack darter cradled in one arm. Thrush stops in front of you, studying you intently for a long moment before speaking. \u201cI came as soon as I could.\u201d She gestures. \u201cWalk with me, and tell me what you know of the reclaimers.\u201d</p><p>You finish your account over a late but welcome meal in Meadow\u2019s common house. Calypsa and Kal Iver arrived partway through the telling. Ben Amon and several of the villagers, including Elder Abel, have gathered, all listening intently to your description of the reclaimers, their rapid life cycle and the danger they pose to the Valley\u2014and to Spire in particular. Thrush listens closely, occasionally asking insightful questions.</p><p>\u201cYou've done well,\" she says. \"A group of seasoned veterans could hardly have done better. I believe your assessment is correct; we have to find some way to stop these reclaimers, or at least limit the destruction they might cause.\u201d</p><p>Elder Abel shakes her head. \u201cA bunch of ruin-eating biomelds that reproduce and spawn in a matter of hours? How are we supposed to stop that? Seems like we should be thinking of getting folks out of Spire as soon as we can and letting the reclaimers have it.\u201d</p><p>You hear murmurs of agreement from the crowd. Kordo\u2019s eyes flash angrily, but before he can speak, Thrush raises her hand. \u201cJust because they are drawn to Spire now, does not mean they will remain there forever. Besides, even if we could evacuate the largest village in the Valley, none of us know just how far the arcology ruins extend underground. If the reclaimers consume too much, they could undermine the entire Valley.\u201d</p><p>She looks back at you. \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid the reclaimers must be dealt with. And since you have learned the most about them, you're the best equipped to find a solution.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Complete the <b>JOURNEY (MEADOW)</b> mission, and gain the <b>REMOVE THE RECLAIMERS</b> mission. Each Ranger soothes 2 fatigue.</p><blockquote id=\"narration_2\"><p>\u201cYou are not alone in this,\" Thrush says. \"We will travel to each village and share what you've learned with others in hopes of finding a solution.\u201d She turns to the room. \"You have all heard the story of the reclaimers,\" she says to several mutters of agreement. \"Does anyone here have an idea for how we might stop them?\"</p><p>Ben Amon speaks up. \u201cThere is a skilled hunter who lives in Tumbledown. I hear this hunter regularly travels to the swamp to prune hydraworms\u2014some of the most mindlessly violent biomelds in the Valley. Perhaps she could provide some insight.\"</p><p>Elder Abel grunts. \u201cNo offense to the great hunters in our presence, but attacking the reclaimers sounds like a fools errand! If you'll recall, we were first made aware of these reclaimers thanks to a flood. Killed a score of them stone dead! Does anyone know where the shaper who caused that flood ran off to? Maybe he can do that again!\u201d Calypsa steps forward. \"No, Elder Abel, but I've learned that his sister lives in Spire. She may know where he's gone.\"</p><p>Elder Thrush nods in satisfaction. \"Thank you all,\" she says, then turns to you. \"Two solid leads. Good luck, and may the ancestors guide you.\"</p></blockquote>",
