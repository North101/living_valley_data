Everything about the biomeld seems designed to be lethal. Why would the ancestors create such a being? What purpose in the ecology could it serve? Perhaps if you find more of them, the answer will be made clear.</p></blockquote><p color=\"red\">B) \u2666\u2666\u2662</p><blockquote id=\"narration_2\"><p>As the reclaimer escapes, you take time to study the tracks it leaves. The patterns its clawed forelimbs leave in the dirt are distinctive, and with a start you realize you've seen these tracks before at numerous points throughout your travels. The reclaimers must be all over the Valley!</p></blockquote><p color=\"red\">C) \u2666\u2666\u2666</p><blockquote id=\"narration_3\"><p>The reclaimer seems to be following a well-worn path, making it easy to pursue. You follow at a distance as it winds through a grove and up, over a hill. You crest the ridge and suddenly stop. At the bottom of the hill, you see numerous sinuous bodies slinking through the underbrush. There must be at least twenty reclaimers. They seem to be milling around an overgrown Estian ruin, occasionally devouring any small animals they find hiding in the underbrush.</p></blockquote><p>Gain the <mission>INVASION - STAGE I</mission> mission.

You shudder to think of what might happen if a pack of these biomelds descended upon a village.</p><p>Unsure of how to approach the herd of dangerous biomelds, you think back on your training. Now that you've observed several reclaimers individually, and now in a pack, it would be wise to share your observations with others to help determine a course of action. Of anyone in the Valley, the people who live and work at the biological outpost south of Branch\u2014experts in biomeld and animal behavior\u2014may be able to offer some insight into what the reclaimers are up to.</p></blockquote><p>Complete the <mission>SECRET INVASION</mission> mission.
