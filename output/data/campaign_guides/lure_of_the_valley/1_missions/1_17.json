As you flee, you are unable to rid your mind of the indelible images\u2014polyps growing from the secretions left by the reclaimers.</p><p>A safe distance away, you review your findings. The reclaimers seem to consume anything artificial\u2014while the Estian ruins were severely damaged, no biological material seems to be affected by the corrosive secretions of the grubs. You\u2019re starting to suspect they might be some sort of recycler organism given over to their singleminded purpose. From what you observed, the reclaimers reproduce asexually: the seekers find a suitable surface and secrete mucus that conjures polyps. Those polyps mature quickly into grubs which then grow into seekers. Left to their own devices, the reclaimers could easily overrun the Valley. A single reclaimer can spawn an entire population all on its own!</p><p>You realize in horror how important the Estian ruins are to the Valley. If the reclaimers fulfill their purpose, no village in the Valley will be safe, for each has repurposed what the Estians left behind to build homes, village centers, workshops, energy collectors, water systems\u2014the list is endless. And Spire, the center of civilization in the Valley, would suffer the most, as it is built entirely upon the arcology ruin. At best, they might devour Spire and the ruins beneath. At worst \u2026 a sobering image of the entire Valley collapsing into the yawning darkness of a kilometers-wide sinkhole seeps into your mind.</p><p>Whatever happens, you need to speak with the Elders and your fellow Rangers. You gather yourself by taking several slow, measured breaths. Your heart rate steadies, and your mind clears. There is time yet to prevent disaster. Then you notice a familiar presence at the edge of your perception\u2014Spirit Speaker Nal reaching out to you from across the Valley. You connect, as if sharing one mind.</p><p>You focus on the still-fresh images of the reclaimer nest and the implications of your discoveries. Nal acknowledges your message.</p><p>You suddenly see images of high grass waving in the wind, flocks of ironwool sheep, and a cleared space around the stump of a dolewood. You recognize it as the village of Meadow, and you understand that Nal wants you to go there as soon as you can. Then Nal\u2019s presence fades and you\u2019re alone once again.</p><p>As you prepare to leave, you suddenly notice that there's a hefty amount of reclaimer mucus clinging to you and your gear. You decide to siphon it into a sample container. Who knows? It may prove useful.</p></blockquote><p>Gain the Reclaimer Mucus reward card.</p><p>Complete <b>INTO THE NEST</b>, and gain the <b>JOURNEY (MEADOW)</b> mission. Each Ranger soothes 2 fatigue.</p><blockquote><p><b>If Ben Amon is in play:</b> \"We must part ways for now. I\u2019ve got to head north. I\u2019ll meet you in Meadow, spirits willing.\u201c He boards the Swift and launches into the air. Return Ben Amon to the Valley set.</p></blockquote>",
