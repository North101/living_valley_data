As you try and catch your breath after the brutal fight, Kordo runs up. \u201cWell done!\u201d he shouts, clapping you on the back.</p><p>You look at the dead biomeld, wondering if killing it was the right call. Kordo looks at you and nods to himself. Then he points around the woodlands. \u201cCome on, take a look.\u201d</p><p>You follow his gestures and see that the forest around you, which seemed so quiet and somber with the mulcher around, is already coming back to life. Squirrels and birds are starting to flit about, and you see a pair of artilopes poke their heads cautiously around a tree. \u201cSee?\u201d Kordo says. \u201cThe ecosystem is already benefiting from this aberration\u2019s absence.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Complete the <b>INTERVENTION</b> mission. Permanently remove the Caustic Mulcher from the Woods set. Each Ranger soothes 2 fatigue.</p><blockquote id=\"narration_2\"><p>After you help Kordo dispose of the caustic mulcher\u2019s body, you start to think. There are several infamous mega-predators throughout the Valley. You remember in your training that some of the Elders want to see these predators eliminated to keep people and the rest of the Valley safe. Perhaps they would appreciate your help with carefully \u201cmanaging\u201d them for the good of the Valley?</p></blockquote>",
