Despite a night dreaming of roiling, hungry masses just beneath your feet, you feel much better rested than you did yesterday.</p><p>Kasende leads you into the murky and mist-filled heart of the Marsh, finding a spit of relatively dry ground to stand on. Then Kasende triggers the lure. Almost immediately, you hear the scuttling, splashing sounds of reclaimers heading toward you. Kasende breathes deep and raises her whispercrack darter. \u201cWe need enough of them here to drive the hydraworms into a feeding frenzy. Until then \u2026 we just have to survive.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Search the Tumbledown set for Kasende, Expert Hunter, and put her into play within reach of a Ranger of your choice. Do not read her entry. Search the General set for five Reclaimer Seekers, and shuffle them into the path deck.</p>",
