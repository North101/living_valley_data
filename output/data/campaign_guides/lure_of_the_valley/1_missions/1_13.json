Zek recognizes you from Ranger training, and both he and Sirisana listen in mounting alarm to your experiences with the reclaimers.</p></blockquote><p><span class=\"text text_red\">If you are currently on Watcher in the Brush, Trail of Vines, or Deeper Motives:</span> Go to <a href=\"#113a\">1.13a</a>.</p><p><span class=\"text text_red\">Otherwise:</span> Go to <a href=\"#113b\">1.13b</a>.</p><h1 id=\"113a\">1.13A</h1><blockquote><p>You mention the mysterious Verdessian that's been lurking about. Sirisana\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cA Verdessian, you say? I have heard about these beings, but I have never seen one myself. Perhaps it would be worthwhile for you to find this being and attempt to communicate with it. It may be able to offer some insight\u2014if it's able to communicate in the first place, of course.\u201d</p></blockquote><choice id=\"rangers-choose\">Rangers Choose</choice><p class=\"text text_red\">A) Return to the outpost after speaking with the Verdessian.</p><blockquote><p>You agree with Sirisana, telling her you\u2019ll attempt to track down the Verdessian and speak with it, then return to the outpost.</p></blockquote><p>Keep the <b>JOURNEY (BIOLOGICAL OUTPOST)</b> mission.</p><p class=\"text text_red\">B) Forget the Verdessian. The reclaimers are all that matter.</p><blockquote><p>You shake your head; although the Verdessian is an interesting lead, it can\u2019t be as important as coming up with a solution to the reclaimer invasion as soon as possible.</p></blockquote><p>Go to 1.13b.</p><h1 id=\"113b\">1.13B</h1><p class=\"text text_red\">If you were <span class=\"text text_blue\">SURPRISED BY THE INVASION</span>:</p><p>Go to <a href=\"campaign_guides/lure_of_the_valley/1_missions/1_14\">1.14</a>.</p><p class=\"text text_red\">If you completed the Sensor Network mission:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWe received the information from the sensors,\u201d Sirisana says as she looks over her notes. \u201cWe noticed a few large clusters of biomeld activity\u2014most of it irregular, primarily around ruins sites. Most likely, if you head in the direction of that activity, you'll find the reclaimers.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Go to <a href=\"campaign_guides/lure_of_the_valley/1_missions/1_14\">1.14</a>.</p><p class=\"text text_red\">If you completed the Secret Invasion mission: </p><blockquote><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d Sirisana says. \"You say they were milling around a ruin?

When Sirisana returns, you see her carrying what looks like a circular pane of glass set in a wooden frame.</p><p>\"I got this at Kobo's Market just last month,\" she says. \"The Messipians use it to track schools of fish, but I've modified it to monitor nearby biomeld and animal activity. I'd like you to have it. It may help you better understand the reclaimers' intentions.\"</p></blockquote><p>Gain the Biosign Sensor reward card.
