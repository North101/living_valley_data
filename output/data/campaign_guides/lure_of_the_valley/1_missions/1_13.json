Zek recognizes you from Ranger training, and both he and Sirisana listen in mounting alarm to your experiences with the reclaimers.</p></blockquote><p><span color=\"red\">If you are currently on Watcher in the Brush, Trail of Vines, or Deeper Motives:</span> Go to <a href=\"#113a\"><entry>1.13a</entry></a>.</p><p><span color=\"red\">Otherwise:</span> Go to <a href=\"#113b\"><entry>1.13b</entry></a>.</p><h1 id=\"113a\">1.13A</h1><blockquote id=\"narration_2\"><p>You mention the mysterious Verdessian that's been lurking about. Sirisana's eyes widen. \"A Verdessian, you say? I have heard about these beings, but I have never seen one myself. Perhaps it would be worthwhile for you to find this being and attempt to communicate with it. It may be able to offer some insight\u2014if it's able to communicate in the first place, of course.\"</p></blockquote><p color=\"red\">A) Return to the outpost after speaking with the Verdessian.</p><blockquote id=\"narration_3\"><p>You agree with Sirisana, telling her you'll attempt to track down the Verdessian and speak with it, then return to the outpost.</p></blockquote><p>Keep the <mission>JOURNEY (BIOLOGICAL OUTPOST)</mission> mission.</p><p color=\"red\">B) Forget the Verdessian. The reclaimers are all that matter.</p><blockquote id=\"narration_4\"><p>You shake your head; although the Verdessian is an interesting lead, it can't be as important as coming up with a solution to the reclaimer invasion as soon as possible.</p></blockquote><p>Go to 1.13b.</p><h1 id=\"113b\">1.13B</h1><p color=\"red\">If you were <event>SURPRISED BY THE INVASION</event>:</p><p>Go to <a href=\"campaign_guides/lure_of_the_valley/1_missions/1_14\"><entry>1.14</entry></a>.</p><p color=\"red\">If you completed the Sensor Network mission:</p><blockquote id=\"narration_5\"><p>\"We received the information from the sensors,\" Sirisana says as she looks over her notes. \"We noticed a few large clusters of biomeld activity\u2014most of it irregular, primarily around ruins sites.

I wonder if there's something about the ruins that draws them.\" She seems to get an idea then excuses herself. When Sirisana returns, you see her carrying what looks like a circular pane of glass set in a wooden frame.</p><p>\"I got this at Kobo's Market just last month,\" she says. \"The Messipians use it to track schools of fish, but I've modified it to monitor nearby biomeld and animal activity. I'd like you to have it. It may help you better understand the reclaimers' intentions.\"</p></blockquote><p>Gain the <reward>Biosign Sensor</reward> reward card.
