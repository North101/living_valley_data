Quiet hisses at you, baring her fangs, but doesn't flinch or snap at you as you reach your hand to her nose. She sniffs, cautiously, and then to your surprise and amazement, she leans forward and gives you an affectionate head rub that sends you tumbling over on your backside.</p><p>Quiet starts to purr quietly, and you feel a warmth steal through your soul at the sound, as if you have some sort of deeper connection with her. You're not sure how you know, but you're convinced she won't come after anyone in the nearby villages now. She seems a lot more interested in you, so she might keep a wary eye on you from afar, and perhaps help you when you need aid.</p></blockquote><p>Complete the <mission>LURE (QUIET)</mission> mission.

Umbra's eyes watch carefully as you reach under her chin and scratch the ruffled feathers there. The raptor doesn't move at first, but after a long moment, she stretches out her huge wings and envelops you in them.</p><p>In the warm darkness beneath her wings, you know you should be afraid but you actually feel safe and comforted. You're not sure how you know, but you're convinced Umbra won't come after anyone in the nearby villages now. She seems almost protective and nurturing of you, so she might keep a concerned eye on you from afar, and perhaps help you when you need aid.</p></blockquote><p>Complete the <mission>LURE (UMBRA)</mission> mission.

You see yourself reflected in Ol' Bloody Clicker's multifaceted eyes as his head angles down to look at you, and you try not to flinch as his long, feathery feelers run delicately across your face and body.</p><p>After a long moment, Ol' Bloody Clicker retreats to the mouth of his tunnel and there watches you with a singular focus. You're not sure how you know, but you're convinced Ol' Bloody Clicker won't come after anyone in the nearby villages now. He seems to respect that this is your territory, so he leaves to hunt elsewhere.</p></blockquote><p>Complete the <mission>LURE (OL' BLOODY CLICKER)</mission> mission.
