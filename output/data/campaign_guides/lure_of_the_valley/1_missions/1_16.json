You hear a soft rustling, like hundreds of reeds rubbing together in the distance. You move quietly through the ruins and find a gap to peek through. There, in the heart of one of the ruins, you can see dozens of reclaimers milling about, and you see several bulbous sacs adhered to every surface. It looks like you\u2019ve found the reclaimer nest.</p></blockquote><p>Ignore the <b>INVASION</b> setup instructions for this location. Instead, search the General set for three Reclaimer Seekers, and shuffle them into the path deck. Then, after setup, search the General set for a Reclaimer Polyp, and put it into play.</p>",
