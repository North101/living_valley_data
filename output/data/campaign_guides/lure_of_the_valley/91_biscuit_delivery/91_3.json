There's no silverfin curry to be had until the fish has marinated for at least three hours!\"</p><p>A head pokes out from behind the pile. \"Oh, it's you! I thought you were Elder Thrush. She gets so impatient on silverfin curry day! Calypsa sent you for the biscuits, eh? They're just out of the oven. Let me know when you're ready to leave, and we'll get you and those biscuits to the good people of White Sky straight away.\"</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Travel away from Lone Tree Station while Hy Pimpot is in play to complete the mission.</i></p>",
