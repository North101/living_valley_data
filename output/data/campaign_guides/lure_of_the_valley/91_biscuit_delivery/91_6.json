She smiles at you like an old friend. \u201cThat was lovely,\u201d she says. \u201cI just had the most amazing experience. I was speaking with the spirit of Mount Nim. It was so powerful! And ancient! It\u2019s a great spirit to call upon if you ever find yourself in need of some perspective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut right now, we should check on the spirits of those biscuits\u201d she says with a playful smirk. \u201cYou\u2019d better find Hy Pimpot and pick them up while they\u2019re still warm!\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Each Ranger soothes 2 fatigue, then discard Nal.</p>",
