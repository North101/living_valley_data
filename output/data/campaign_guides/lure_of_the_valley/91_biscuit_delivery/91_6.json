She smiles at you like an old friend. \"That was lovely,\" she says. \"I just had the most amazing experience. I was speaking with the spirit of Mount Nim. It was so powerful! And ancient! It's a great spirit to call upon if you ever find yourself in need of some perspective.\"</p><p>\"But right now, we should check on the spirits of those biscuits\" she says with a playful smirk. \"You'd better find Hy Pimpot and pick them up while they're still warm!\"</p></blockquote><p>Each Ranger soothes 2 fatigue, then discard Nal.</p>",
