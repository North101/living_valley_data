Survived more atrox attacks than I can count!\" Kordo rubs his chin. \"Once, I was one of the best hunters in the Valley. I suppose I still am, but these days I spend most of my time keeping things running smoothly around here. Though I do get out for a hunt every now and then.\"</p><p>His voice takes on a tone of mock severity. \"I'd take you on a hunt right now, in fact, but you have some biscuits to deliver! You're not going to let the people of White Sky starve are you?\"</p></blockquote><p>Each Ranger soothes 2 fatigue, then discard Kordo.</p>",
