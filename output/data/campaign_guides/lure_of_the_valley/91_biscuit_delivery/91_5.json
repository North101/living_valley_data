Survived more atrox attacks than I can count!\u201d Kordo rubs his chin. \u201cOnce, I was one of the best hunters in the Valley. I suppose I still am, but these days I spend most of my time keeping things running smoothly around here. Though I do get out for a hunt every now and then.\u201d</p><p>His voice takes on a tone of mock severity. \u201cI\u2019d take you on a hunt right now, in fact, but you have some biscuits to deliver!
