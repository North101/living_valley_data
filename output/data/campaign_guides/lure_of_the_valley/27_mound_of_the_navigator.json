Many centuries ago, the Estians cultivated an arboretum at the summit of the mound and carved the narrow switchback trails that lead there. As you approach, a flock of dark-feathered birds lifts to the sky, leading your eye out into the Valley and to the distant mountains beyond.</p></blockquote>",
