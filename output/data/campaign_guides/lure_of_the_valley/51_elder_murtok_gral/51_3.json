He has a long, thin fishing pole in one hand, casting with quick, practiced motions. He seems distracted, however, staring at the distant shore.</p><p>\"Oh, hello,\" he says. \"Always good to have Rangers on the platforms.\" His eyes never leave the shoreline. He seems to be looking for something.</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear Elder Murtok with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to find out what's on his mind.</i></p>",
