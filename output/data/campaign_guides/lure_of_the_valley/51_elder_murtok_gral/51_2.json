He has a long, thin fishing pole in one hand, casting with quick, practiced motions. His eyes are closed; he seems to be fishing entirely by feel.</p><p>His eyes drift open. \"I recognize those footsteps,\" he says. \"I must say, it's nice to know that Quiet isn't lurking about anymore. But it does feel different without her. Doesn't it?\"</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear Elder Murtok with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to ask what there is to do around White Sky.</i></p>",
