He has a long, thin fishing pole in one hand, casting with quick, practiced motions. His eyes are closed; he seems to be fishing entirely by feel.</p><p>His eyes drift open. \u201cI recognize those footsteps,\u201d he says. \u201cI must say, it\u2019s nice to know that Quiet isn\u2019t lurking about anymore.
