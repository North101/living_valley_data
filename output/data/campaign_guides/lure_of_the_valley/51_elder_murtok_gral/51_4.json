Including myself! I recommend talking to Ar Tel about that. Otherwise, you could always swim down to the Bubble and see if Silaro needs help. He'd be happy for the company!\"</p><p>As you make to leave, he taps your arm. \"Also, if you need help getting around the lake, talk to Vira. She may be gruff, but she's the best barge pilot I know.\"</p></blockquote><blockquote id=\"narration_2\"><p><b>If you are on REMOVE THE RECLAIMERS:</b> You tell the elder about the reclaimer threat, and he looks at you with worried eyes. \"That's a lot on your shoulders. I'm not sure our little village can help. We barely managed against that flood ... say, that's an idea! Where did that foolish shaper get off to? Those flood waters he summoned would surely be strong enough to sweep some reclaimers away. I think his sister, Dace, is still living in Spire. Maybe ask her.\"</p></blockquote>",
