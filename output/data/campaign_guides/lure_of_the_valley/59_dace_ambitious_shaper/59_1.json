He was pretty distraught the first time. I don't think he'll be up for it.\"</p><p>You tell her that Aell is the best hope the Valley has and that it would be a mistake not to at least try to convince him to help.</p><p>After a moment, she agrees. \"You're right. I know you're right. I can be misled by my feelings about my brother. I wouldn't be able to convince him to cause another flood, but you might. Before he left, he told me he was going to go somewhere to practice his manifestations\u2014somewhere he couldn't accidentally do anyone harm. You'll find him in the Marsh of Rebirth.\"</p></blockquote><p>Gain the <mission>LOST BROTHER</mission> mission.</p>",
