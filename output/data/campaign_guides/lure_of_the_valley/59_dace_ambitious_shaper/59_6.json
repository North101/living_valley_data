There are shapers in the Monastery that know how to fly. I've trained with them for years. And everyone knows the story of the shaper who flew to Plateau.\"</p><p>She sighs. \"Oh, I don't know why I'm bothering with this. Master Cress always said that I wouldn't really learn to fly unless I cast myself into the empty air from a great height. He always had a flair for the dramatic, but I think he may be right. I've just never been able to fully commit and trust in my ability.\"</p><p>She suddenly looks at you. \"You know what? I say it's now or never. Do you know the way to the Plummet? Can you take me there so I can jump off?\"</p></blockquote><p><span color=\"red\">A) Sounds fun. Let's do it.</span> Discard all <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon>, and attach the <mission>HELPING HAND</mission> mission to Dace.</p><p><span color=\"red\">B) I don't know about this plan of yours.</span> Although you can't help today, you spend some time speaking with her about her ambitions toward flight. Discard Dace, and write <event>KIND WORDS WITH DACE</event> on the campaign tracker.</p>",
