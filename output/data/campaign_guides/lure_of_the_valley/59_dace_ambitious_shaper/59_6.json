There are shapers in the Monastery that know how to fly. I\u2019ve trained with them for years. And everyone knows the story of the shaper who flew to Plateau.\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m bothering with this. Master Cress always said that I wouldn\u2019t really learn to fly unless I cast myself into the empty air from a great height. He always had a flair for the dramatic, but I think he may be right. I\u2019ve just never been able to fully commit and trust in my ability.\u201d</p><p>She suddenly looks at you. \u201cYou know what? I say it's now or never. Do you know the way to the Plummet? Can you take me there so I can jump off?\u201d</p></blockquote><choice id=\"rangers-choose\">Rangers Choose</choice><p><span color=\"red\">A) Sounds fun.
