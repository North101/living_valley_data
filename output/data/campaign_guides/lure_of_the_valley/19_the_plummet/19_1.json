You hear her repeating, quietly \u201cI am light as a feather, rising to the sun,\u201d over and over.</p><p>You start to say something about there being a better way to test this, but suddenly Dace hurls herself over the cliff! You dash to the edge to see her falling, then slowing, then gracefully gliding at the pace of a brisk walk. As she reaches the base of the Plummet, she stops, rises back up, then settles softly to the ground.</p><p>You can hear her whoop of victory echoing off the rocks.</p></blockquote><p>Gain the Light as a Feather reward card. Discard Dace. Return <b>HELPING HAND</b> to the collection. Record <span color=\"blue\">SEEN A PERSON FLY </span> on the campaign tracker.</p>",
