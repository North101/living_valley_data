  "content": "<blockquote><p>Deep in the marsh, it's easy to stray from the path. Too easy. Your mind wanders, your feet wander, and your eyes wander to things they shouldn't. Things that would otherwise remain unread.</p><p>You snap out of your momentary reverie, realizing your wandering has brought you into a fog that reeks of ozone and crackles with a savage power. Next time, you will keep your eyes on the path.</p></blockquote><p>The first time you read this entry for any reason, replace the weather with Electric Fog.</p>",
