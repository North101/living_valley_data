You call to him, and he looks up from a loosely bound notebook.</p><p>\u201cGreetings,\u201d he nods slightly. \u201cCormak Wellers, at your service.\u201d</p><p>You recognize the name; Elder Wellers is the head of Tumbledown and a naturalist of some renown within the Valley. You ask what he\u2019s doing, and he shows the tight, neat writing in his book next to a diagram of what looks like a large tree.</p><p>\u201cJust making observations,\u201d he says. \u201cYou never know what you\u2019ll see when you wait and watch.\u201d</p></blockquote><p><i><p color=\"blue\">Clear Elder Wellers with <span><icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon></span> to ask him if he needs any help around Tumbledown.</p></i></p>",
