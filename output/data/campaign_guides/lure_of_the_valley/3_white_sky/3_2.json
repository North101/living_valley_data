When the moon is in waning gibbous, the people of White Sky invite their neighbors to join them in a celebration of the lake and the bounty it provides. The platforms are alive with people. You can\u2019t take two steps without someone offering you delicious food. Music and laughter fill the air.</p></blockquote><p>Search the Valley set for up to three humans, and shuffle them into the path deck. This is in addition to the cards added from the White Sky set.</p>",
