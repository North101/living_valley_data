The village itself was mostly unharmed. A few boats were displaced or lost, and the utility buildings near the shoreline took a beating, but thankfully that\u2019s about it. Everywhere you go, you see villagers hard at work, cleaning up around the lake. If you can spare the time, they would appreciate your help.</p></blockquote><p>Search the General set for Flood Damage, and put it into play.</p>",
