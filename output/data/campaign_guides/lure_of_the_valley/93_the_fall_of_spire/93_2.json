You hear a bellowing voice shout \u201c\u2014and stay out!\u201d</p><p>You look in the window and see Elder Orlin standing in front of a group of frightened villagers. She spins a large hammer in slow circles, and as she does, the hammer\u2019s head begins to glow blue and hum. As you start to call out to her, another reclaimer charges through a side door, and Elder Orlin pivots and swings. The hammer connects with the reclaimer\u2019s chest with a flash of blue light and the tang of ozone. Then she turns and catches sight of you.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get these people to safety!\u201d she says, swinging her hammer once again.</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear Elder Orlin with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to get her group out of the city.</i></p><p>If you have <span color=\"blue\">IMPRESSED ELDER ORLIN</span>, add 2 <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to her.</p>",
