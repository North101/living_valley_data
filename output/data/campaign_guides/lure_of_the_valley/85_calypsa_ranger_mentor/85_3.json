When we move through it, we cannot help but affect it.\u201d She takes a few steps then gestures behind her to the grass crushed beneath her boots. \u201cThat\u2019s why we should think before we act. It can often be better to observe and otherwise avoid the living things in the Valley. And when we can\u2019t observe \u2026 \u201d</p><p>She reaches into her pocket and pulls out a small chunk of meat. She tosses it into the middle of a field, and you hear a screech. An eagle swoops down, pouncing on the morsel.

Sometimes, there are too many to avoid or even to distract. Sometimes, you have to press on, even when it\u2019s dangerous or tiring. Exhaustion, fatigue; these can be worthwhile trade-offs for accomplishing important tasks. You need to be willing to push yourself, and tire yourself, if you\u2019re going to get everything done in a day that you need to do.\u201d</p><p>She looks at you and Kal. \u201cPerhaps a competition will teach you what I mean. Which of you can push yourselves more? Shall we find out?\u201d</p></blockquote><p><i><p color=\"blue\">If you take on this challenge, it will discard your current fatigue stack.</p></i></p><choice id=\"rangers-choose\">Rangers Choose</choice><p color=\"red\">A) Agree to the test.</p><blockquote><p>Calypsa smiles. \u201cVery good! Alright, go and suffer as much fatigue as you can, then come check back in with me. Whoever pushes themselves further will get a reward.\u201d</p><p>Kal grins at you. \u201cI\u2019d wish you good luck, but all the luck in the world isn\u2019t going to help you beat me.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Discard all <span><icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon></span>, and attach the <b>HELPING HAND</b> mission to Calypsa.
