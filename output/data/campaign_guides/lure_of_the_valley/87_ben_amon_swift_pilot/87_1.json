You look up in relief to see the shape of Ben Amon\u2019s custom-made glider, the Swift, passing overhead. It lands gently in a clearing a short distance away. As you approach, you see Ben Amon emerge from the cockpit, stretch his legs, then check something on the underside of the vehicle.</p><p>\"Hello there!\" he says, looking up from his work. \"I'm on an errand for Elder Thrush, but if you're in need of assistance, maybe I can give you a ride.\"</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear Ben with <span><icon icon=\"ranger_token\">&nbsp;</icon></span> to board the Swift.</i></p>",
