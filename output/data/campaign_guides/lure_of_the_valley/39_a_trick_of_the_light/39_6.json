C\u2019mon then, let\u2019s keep after it!\u201d</p><p>Kordo quickly spots wisps of fur, small impressions in the ground, bent grass, and other signs of passage. He leads you on a rapid chase through the trees, pointing out each sign as he passes.</p><p>After a long five minutes of running through the forest, the yeti stops on the far side of a small clearing. Kordo stops next to you and holds out his hands. \u201cWait, wait. We mean you no harm.\u201d</p><p>The yeti looks at you all for a moment, but especially at Kordo. Then, slowly and deliberately, it nods. It takes a small silver ovoid from somewhere and sets it on the loam. Then, without any fuss, it fades into nothingness and disappears. Kordo stands unmoving, a smile as wide as the Valley on his face and tears of joy in his eyes.</p><p>Later that day, Kordo finishes packing his bag. \u201cI\u2019m headed back to Lone Tree. Thank you for this. I won\u2019t forget it.\u201d</p><p>You clasp his shoulder and say farewell. He saunters down the trail, whistling a jaunty tune.</p></blockquote><p>Discard Kordo.
