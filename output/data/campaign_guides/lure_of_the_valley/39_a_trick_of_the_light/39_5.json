You look for tracks, signs of passage, anything to guide your way. Then suddenly, you come around a tree and find yourself face to face with a tall, furry humanoid, with features that seem to be a blend between human and ... something else. You\u2019ve heard stories of the yeti before, but you thought they were just that: stories!</p><p>You look at the yeti for a long moment, and it looks back at you. Its eyes meet yours, and you feel oddly at peace, as if you and this yeti share an ancient kinship.</p><p>You begin to speak, and in response, it rumbles in a low, somehow nonthreatening, manner. Then it steps back, and slips behind a tree. You move to follow, but it\u2019s no longer there. Something glints on the ground, however, right where the being had been standing.</p></blockquote><p>Gain Translocator reward card.
