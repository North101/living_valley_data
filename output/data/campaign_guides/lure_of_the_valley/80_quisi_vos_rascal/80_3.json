You move around a large cedar bole to find a young girl, maybe eight years old, tracing patterns in the ground with a rock. She\u2019s covered in dirt, head to toe. In place of her left hand is a miraculous piece of technology: a prosthesis, gleaming in the sunlight, its fingers suspended in air, held only by her body\u2019s memory of the hand.</p><p>As soon as she notices you, she hops to her feet. \u201cHi! I\u2019m Quisi! What are you doing? Where are you going? What is that? Can I use it?\u201d</p><p>Each time you answer a question, she has another one at the ready. It seems like you have a new traveling companion, at least until you can satisfy her curiosity.</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear Quisi with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to satisfy her curiosity.</i></p>",
