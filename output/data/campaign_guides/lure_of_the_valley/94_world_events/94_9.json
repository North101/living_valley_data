You carefully load it with some homemade flare rounds, then begin to fire off the signals and hope for rescue.</p><p>After hours of waiting, you see a pair of stilt-horse riders heading toward you. You help her onto the back of one of the great steeds.

Kal Iver spent days searching for her in the southern swamps, before finding her close to death and hauling Kasende back to Tumbledown while fighting off swarming hydraworms. Stories of his daring rescue are already spreading up and down the Silverfin. Kasende is recovering from her injuries, and by all accounts, already planning her next hunt.</p></blockquote><p>If you have <mission>SEARCH (KASENDE)</mission>, complete it.
