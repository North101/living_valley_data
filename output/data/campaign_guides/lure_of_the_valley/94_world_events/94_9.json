Zek Tsal is at the edge of your camp on his stilt-horse. When he sees you, he tosses a bundle to you. \u201cGlad to hand that off. Kasende says thanks!\u201d Then he takes off. You unwrap the oiled paper to find it full of greasy hydraworm jerky. The smell is \u2026 pungent, but you\u2019re pretty sure she meant it as a sincere gift.</p></blockquote><p>Each Ranger gains one energy in an aspect of their choice for the first round.</p><p><span color=\"red\">If you\u2019re currently on</span> <b>RESCUE (KASENDE):</b></p><blockquote><p>Kasende has stopped responding to your jokes, and she is barely breathing. You can\u2019t move her, but you\u2019re worried she may suffer permanent injury without the help of a healer. You make her comfortable, then take her whispercrack darter and carry it to a nearby rise. You carefully load it with some homemade flare rounds, then begin to fire off the signals and hope for rescue.</p><p>After hours of waiting, you see a pair of stilt-horse riders heading toward you. You help her onto the back of one of the great steeds. You watch as they ride away, thankful that help arrived when it did.</p></blockquote><p>Complete <b>RESCUE (KASENDE)</b>, and record <span color=\"blue\">HELPED RESCUE KASENDE</span> on the campaign tracker.</p><p color=\"red\">Otherwise:</p><blockquote><p>You receive word from a stilt-horse courier that Kasende has been found. Kal Iver spent days searching for her in the southern swamps, before finding her close to death and hauling Kasende back to Tumbledown while fighting off swarming hydraworms. Stories of his daring rescue are already spreading up and down the Silverfin. Kasende is recovering from her injuries, and by all accounts, already planning her next hunt.</p></blockquote><p>If you have <b>SEARCH (KASENDE)</b>, complete it. If you don't, gain that mission and immediately complete it. Record <span color=\"blue\">KAL RESCUED KASENDE</span> on the campaign tracker.</p>",
