Some lurking among distant trees, others so close you had to flee or hide from them in the brush. The signs are clear; the reclaimers have invaded the Valley. Since they now seem to be everywhere, you decide there's no longer a need to search for them.</p></blockquote><p>If you have <b>JOURNEY (SPIRE)</b>, <b>SECRET INVASION</b>, or <b>SENSOR NETWORK</b>, complete them. Write <span class=\"text text_blue\">SURPRISED BY THE INVASION</span> on the campaign tracker. Gain the <b>INVASION - STAGE I</b> mission.</p><blockquote><p>You consider your options and determine that, if you want to do something about these reclaimers, the best people to talk to would be the experts in biomeld and animal behavior who live and work at the biological outpost south of Branch. If anyone can, they may be able to offer insight into how to deal with them.</p></blockquote><p>Gain the <b>JOURNEY (BIOLOGICAL OUTPOST)</b> mission.
