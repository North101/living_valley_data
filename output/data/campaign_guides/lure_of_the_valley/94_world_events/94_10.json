There was a deafening chatter of insects, calling birds, and other sounds you couldn't recognize. You remember stopping before a tree which began to grow before your very eyes, stretching toward the sky like you were observing centuries of growth in the span of a few minutes. As the tree grew wider and wider, you felt the sudden need to escape, but when you tried, you found that you could not move. You looked down to see that your feet had taken root. You were no longer human, but a Verdessian. Just before the tree consumed you, you awoke.</p><p>You spend a moment contemplating your experience. You consider the possibility it wasn't a dream at all, but instead a message from the Verdessian. If it is, you're not sure how to interpret it. Regardless, you suddenly feel very awake and very alert.</p></blockquote><p>Each Ranger gains one energy in an aspect of their choice for the first round.</p><p><span color=\"red\">If you\u2019re currently on</span> <b>DEEPER MOTIVES:</b></p><blockquote id=\"narration_2\"><p>You wake to discover that the haversack you were using to carry the Verdessian is empty.
