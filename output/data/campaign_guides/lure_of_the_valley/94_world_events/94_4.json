It\u2019s expected that when travelers cross paths on the trails, they take a few moments to share stories of local events.</p><p>The last few times you\u2019ve stopped to talk, all the stories have been about the reclaimers. A few people report being attacked by reclaimer seekers, and more have seen them moving in the forests and woodlands. Nearly all such sightings and attacks seem to take place near structures or old Estian ruins. It certainly sounds like they\u2019re making themselves at home in the Valley.</p></blockquote><p>Complete <b>INVASION - STAGE I</b>, and gain <b>INVASION - STAGE II</b>.
