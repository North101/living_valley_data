I noticed that some of the reclaimers had white flowers sprouting from their spines, and that those reclaimers seemed to be leading the way for the others, so I killed one and harvested these.\"</p><p>The hunter reaches into her pocket and pulls out a vial containing several small white flowers.</p><p>\"I've learned that these flowers have no odor, but strangely, they emit an inaudible sound\u2014a sonic vibration that only other reclaimers can perceive, and with the help of the artificers of Tumbledown, I developed a lure. It works, but even if we could amplify the sound enough to attract all the reclaimers in the Valley, I don't know what we'd do with them once they were all gathered in one place.\"</p><p>You suggest that perhaps the place is what's important\u2014someplace from which the reclaimers couldn't escape. Someplace like...</p><p>\"The Marsh of Rebirth,\" Kasende says. \"Of course! Hydraworms will eat anything! Once they\u2019re lured deep into the swamp, they should handle the rest. We just need to get them there!\"</p><p>Kasende leaves for a moment, then comes back with a bundle of small devices. \u201cYou take these lure amplifiers and set them at the borders of the swamp, then come and meet me in the Marsh of Rebirth where I'll prepare the lure itself. Before I leave, I'll let Elder Wellers know our plan. He can send word to Lone Tree Station. I'd like to think we can handle it, but who knows? We might need backup.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Gain the <b>WORM FOOD</b> mission. Check off the right-most bubble next to it. It is not used for this mission.</p>",
