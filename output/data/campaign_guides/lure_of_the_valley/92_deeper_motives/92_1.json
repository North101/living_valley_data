The haversack holding the trapped Verdessian has started to shake and rustle more and more, and you\u2019ve had to stop several times to push the budding vines back under the pack\u2019s flaps. But eventually, you see the Valley drop away into the great green ocean of the Verdessa and hear the constant, muted roar of the waterfall.</p><p>Nal meets you upon a wide balcony. She clasps your arms and gestures to the vast jungle below. \u201cWith the Verdessa so close, I think I will be able to communicate with the Verdessian.\u201d She nods to the pack. \u201cGo ahead and open it.\u201d</p><p>You empty the haversack onto the ground, and immediately the ball of vines and roots flows upward and forms into the figure of the Verdessian. Slowly, it turns to Nal. \u201cWe mean you no harm,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cThe spirit of the Verdessa has offered to help us communicate with each other. Will you speak with us?\u201d The Verdessian opens the petals of its face, revealing vibrant reds and purples. Its stamens flex like fingers.</p><p>\u201cIt agrees,\u201d Nal says. \u201cBut it says we must converse on soft ground.\u201d You accompany them to a patch of grass on the cliffs looking over the Verdessa. Nal closes her eyes, and her breath becomes steady and rhythmic. She and the Verdessian begin to speak.</p></blockquote><p>Search the Lone Tree set for Spirit Speaker Nal, and put her into play within reach of a Ranger of your choice.
