  "content": "<blockquote><p>As the plains around Meadow rise up to meet the cliffs on the western edge of the Valley, you reach the first of the Concordant Ziggurats. Some say that they are part of an unfinished network of power stations, but no one knows for sure. There are five intact ziggurats in the Valley, along with the ruins of several others, and travelers from beyond claim to have seen identical structures as well.</p><p>As you near the base, you feel a resonant thrum. It vibrates the very air around you, causing pressure to build inside your head. The Ziggurats\u2014whatever they are\u2014yet live.</p></blockquote>",
