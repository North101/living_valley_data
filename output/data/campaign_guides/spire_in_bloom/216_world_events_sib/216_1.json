A soft breeze plays across your skin, and the sun rises over the mountaintops, casting its golden light upon the newly bloomed flowers that cover the hillside.</p><p>Hummingbirds and cloudhive bees flit here and there among them. You can't remember seeing so many flowers in one place in your entire life.</p><p>\"A glorious morning, is it not?\" You're stirred from your reverie by a man's voice calling from the trail. You recognize Raemon from your travels\u2014he often runs caravans of both supplies and people to and from Spire. He approaches your camp and shakes your hand in greeting. </p><p>\"It's always a pleasure to meet a Ranger on the trail. Looks like the weather is going to be perfect for the Blossom Festival, doesn't it? What good fortune!\"</p><p>This is the first you've heard of a \"Blossom Festival,\" but you're not surprised by the news. There's been abundant (and abnormal) floral growth all over the Valley for much of the current cycle, and Spire's Master of Revels, Etra Lash, is known to organize impromptu celebrations for occasions such as these. It is strange, you think to yourself, to see so many plants flowering at once\u2014and so many out of season. You wonder aloud at the cause.</p><p>Raemon laughs. \"I have responsibilites enough without troubling myself with such questions,\" he says. \"But if you want to unravel the mysteries of nature, I wish you luck on your quest. May the ancestors guide you!\" </p><p>With that, Raemon waves goodbye and returns to the trail. You see him join up with a caravan of hoversleds and stilt-horse wagons traveling in the direction of White Sky.</p><p>As you prepare for the day ahead, you imagine the delights that the Blossom Festival might hold\u2014honeyed sunberry wine, the luxurious sounds of a dolewood lute, specially prepared foods and confections created by Spire's most talented chefs\u2026</p><p>\u2026perhaps you should go to the festival grounds of Brookside, the small village on the riverbank across from Spire itself, to see how preparations for the festival are coming along. Rangers are tasked with aiding the people of the Valley in whatever way they can, after all. Maybe they could use a hand. </p><p>You start down the trail, and watch as the cloudhive bees dance among the flowers.</p></blockquote><p>On the day track, record Wild Growth underneath the weather for today, three days from now, six days from now, and nine days from now. On those days, use Wild Growth instead of the indicated\u00a0weather.</p><p>Return the current weather to the collection and replace it with Wild Growth.</p><p>Record <a>216.2</a> ten days from now on the day track. If you completed <b>REMOVE THE RECLAIMERS</b>, record it six days from now instead.
