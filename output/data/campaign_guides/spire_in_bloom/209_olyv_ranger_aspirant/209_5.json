It's surely only a matter of time before she's ready to get back out there.</p><p>\"Maybe,\" she says thoughtfully, and at this a light seems to kindle behind her eyes. \"Say, would you be willing to help me? You're right. I can't just sit around at Lone Tree Station for the rest of my life, but I'd feel a lot more confident if a full-fledged Ranger was by my side. What do you say?\"</p></blockquote><p color=\"red\">A) Absolutely. Let's get out there!</p><p>Discard all <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> from Olyv and attach the <mission>HELPING HAND</mission> mission to her. </p><p color=\"blue\"><i>Add as much XP to Olyv as you think she needs, then clear her with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to see if she's ready to overcome her fear and finally don the cloak.</i></p><p color=\"red\">B) Sorry, Olyv. You need to figure this out on your own.</p><p>Discard Olyv. Each Ranger soothes 2 fatigue.</p>",
