Having gone through much of your training together, you remember Olyv well, but you also remember that during the Atrox Mountain night hike, an important exercise in every Ranger's training, she fell from a great height and broke both her legs. It was a sobering experience for everyone involved, and a not-so-subtle reminder that the life of a Ranger is often perilous.</p><p>Because of her injury, Olyv needed to spend many moons in recovery, and fell behind in her training as a result. It does your heart good to see her up and about again. She cautiously hops down as you approach.</p><p>\"Hey! How's your patrol going?\" she asks. \"Must be nice to finally be done with your training, huh?\" Her voice is tinged with a bit of envy.</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear Olyv with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to ask her how training is going.</i></p>",
