Bright-winged birds circle high above, occassionally diving into the current to pluck a wriggling fish from the water.</p><p>Crowded piers extend out into the river, where several skiffs and seed barges are moored. The air smells strongly of fish. Dockworkers and river pilots are busy unloading the day's catch and loading up boats with goods bound for other villages along the river. From here, one could take a boat to and from the riverbank, or up and down the Silverfin itself.</p></blockquote>",
