The tales about the Great Ursus, Deadfall, don't do her justice. She's enormous\u2014more than a thousand kilos of fur and muscle, nearly five meters tall, with claws that could strip the bark from a dolewood.</p><p>As she strides forward, you notice she seems to move with a bit of a limp. Even injured, however, she seems no less formidable.</p><p>Deadfall rears onto her hind limbs and roars once more, clearly enraged. What has her so worked up?</p></blockquote>",
