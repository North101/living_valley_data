  "content": "<blockquote id=\"narration_1\"><p>With a mournful groan, Deadfall slumps to the ground. Her rampage has come to an end, and while you may have completed your mission, a part of you wishes the outcome could have been different. Despite everything, she was a magnificent being. Though the inhabitants of the Valley will sleep better knowing they are safe, none will celebrate her passing. You bow your head in respect, and after a moment of silence, you dislodge the kinetic glass shard from Deadfall's great paw. The glass is cracked, but it's razor-sharp and still highly mutable. Perhaps you can find a use for it.</p></blockquote><p>Complete the <mission>TRACKING DESTRUCTION (DEADFALL)</mission> mission. Return Deadfall to the collection and permanently remove her from the Valley set. Each Ranger soothes 2 fatigue. Gain the <reward>Adaptive Glass Shard</reward> reward card, placing 4 checkmarks next to it. You have unlocked that many copies of this reward card.</p>",
