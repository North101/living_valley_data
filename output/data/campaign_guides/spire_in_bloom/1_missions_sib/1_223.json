Two stick figures stand at the bottom of the first page, one with a crudely drawn but impressive beard labeled \"ELDER HALE,\" the other with what appears to be a large glove on one hand, labeled \"ME.\"</p><p><i>Dear Elder Hale,</i></p><p><i>I did like you said and wrote down everything I could remember about my adventure in the Old Forest. It was hard! It's not hard to REMEMBER. I can do that! I just don't want to WRITE about it. I know you said it's important, but I still think it's more fun to just DO STUFF. Writing is SO BORING! Sorry, Elder! Anyway, here it is. I called it THE CHUBBY FROG AND THE BEARSLOTH WHO ATE HIM AND IT WAS SAD SO I CRIED.</i></p><p><i>SEE YOU NEXT TIME!</i></p><p><i>~ QUISI</i></p><p>You can't help but smile as you tuck the pages carefully into your pack.</p></blockquote>",
