Well, it finally happened. A hunter by the name of Kasende, all the way up from Tumbledown, came through the door yesterday, calm as you please, garafon antlers in one hand, whispercrack darter in the other, and says, \"Where should I put this thing?\"</i></p><p><i>When I saw those antlers, why, I nearly fell over! I just knew it was your garafon. I could tell because the antlers still bore the scars from your gauzeblade!</i></p><p><i>I hope all is well at the Root, and that you're keeping your hunting skills sharp.</i></p><p><i>Spirits guide you,</i></p><p><i>Viv</i></p></blockquote>",
