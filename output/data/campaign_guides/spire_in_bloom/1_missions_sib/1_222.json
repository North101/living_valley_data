We still need someone to gather flowers for the table arrangements, and to make matters worse, Raemon still hasn't arrived with the supplies or fresh fish for the feast from White Sky! Any help you could offer would be greatly appreciated.\" Without waiting for a reply, Etra turns back to the volunteers setting up the main tent. \"That's it!\" he cheers. \"All together now\u2026!\"</p><p>You ponder the choice. Collecting flowers is likely something you can do while you're traveling all across the Valley, whereas helping Raemon deliver supplies will require you to travel to White Sky and back. </p></blockquote><choice id=\"rangers-choose\">RANGERS CHOOSE</choice><p color=\"red\">A) Check in on Raemon.</p><p>Gain the <b>SUPPLY RUN</b> mission.</p><p color=\"red\">B) Gather flowers for the table arrangements.</p><p>Gain the <b>FLOWER COLLECTION</b> mission.</p>",
