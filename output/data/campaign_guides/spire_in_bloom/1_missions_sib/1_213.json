Etra clears his throat and addresses the crowd. \"Friends\u2026I think this is as good a time as ever to bring this Blossom Festival to a close.\" The crowd is mostly quiet, but there are a few chuckles and some playful boos that lead to a unanimous, if somewhat sullen, applause. \"Thank you one and all for attending!\"</p></blockquote><p color=\"red\">3+ Mirth</p><blockquote id=\"narration_2\"><p>The cloudhive easily dealt with, festival-goers emerge from beneath tables and other improvised shelters, and the festivities begin once more. Despite the brief interruption, the festival goes on to be nothing short of a resounding success.</p><p>Even as the sun begins to dip below the western range, and the moon and stars appear in the sky, the festival continues. </p><p>You find Etra and Raemon, laughing and enjoying a small cask of sunberry wine together . \"Join us!\" Raemon calls, raising his cup. \"We were just giving thanks for such an incredible festival\u2013\u2013bees and all.\"</p></blockquote><p><b>\u00bb Continue reading:</b></p><blockquote id=\"narration_3\"><p>\"Many thanks to you as well,\" Etra says with a bow of respect. \"Without your quick thinking, I imagine this place would still be swarming!\" With that he excuses himself, and ducks into the main tent, then re-emerges holding a cloak crafted of leaves, vines, and flowers.</p><p>\"It was made to be decorative,\" he says, handing it to you. \"But watching you handle those bees, I imagine you could find all sorts of creative uses for it while you're out on patrol. May it bring you good fortune.\"</p><p>You thank Etra for the gift and clasp the cloak proudly about your shoulders.</p><p>As darkness falls and the lambance rigs are lit, you pause for a moment to look upon the festival grounds. There you see the people of the Valley, the people to whom you've dedicated your life as a Ranger, and it's medicine for the heart to see them gathered here, laughing and enjoying each other's company despite the events of the day.</p><p>With a satisfied sigh, you gather your gear and prepare for the trail. </p></blockquote><p>Complete the <b>BUZZKILL</b> mission.
