  "content": "<blockquote id=\"narration_1\"><p>As the hours pass and the feast draws near, you begin to notice more and more cloudhive bees buzzing about. One lands on the rim of your carbonforged cup and very nearly takes a swim in your sunberry wine. You set down your cup and start patrolling the grounds.</p><p>The bees are everywhere, mostly dancing in the air a few meters above the heads of festival-goers, but you notice more than one person swatting at the air or ducking for cover.</p><p>You spot Etra on his way to the front of the main tent, presumably to announce the start of the feast. Just then you hear a droning buzz in the distance, and a looming shadow begins to crawl over the festival grounds.</p><p>The sound grows and grows until it rises above even the clamor of the festival. A few people excitedly point to the sky, yelling in surprise. Your gaze snaps upward and it takes you a moment to comprehend what you're seeing.</p><p>What you first took for a small, dark cloud is actually the underside of a massive cloudhive, its bees gathered in ritualistic flight, holding it aloft, moving it steadily across the\u00a0sky.</p><p>Someone yells in alarm, and the crowds scatter as a wide tornado of bees descends upon the festival grounds. Swarms terrorize the thoroughfares, gathering on the floral decorations, and on the food and drink, much of it still in the hands of fleeing villagers.</p><p>You call out to everyone to shed their floral jewelry, but it's not enough to stop the chaos. There's not a doubt in your mind; you have to find a way to get these bees out of here before they ruin the entire festival!</p></blockquote><p>Complete <b>THE FESTIVITIES BEGIN</b> and gain the <b>BUZZKILL</b> mission. Search the Old Growth set for a Cloudhive and two Cloudhive Swarms. The lead Ranger puts the Cloudhive and one Cloudhive Swarm into play. The next Ranger puts the other Cloudhive Swarm into play (if there is only one Ranger, shuffle it into the path deck instead).</p><h1 id=\"1211a\">1.211a</h1><blockquote id=\"narration_2\"><p>Try as you might, you're unable to repel the cloudhive. Countless bees swarm the festival grounds. Everyone has scattered.</p><p>The Blossom Festival has come to an abrupt and tragic end. What's worse, the cloudhive appears to be staying put, making Brookside its new home.</p></blockquote><p>Complete the <b>BUZZKILL</b> mission. Record <span color=\"blue\"><b>BROOKSIDE INFESTED</b></span> on your campaign tracker.</p><h1 id=\"1211b\">1.211B</h1><blockquote id=\"narration_3\"><p>The aggressive, droning buzz of the cloudhive begins to falter, and you get the impression by the tenor of their song that the colony has decided that Brookside simply isn't worth the trouble. The beleaguered cloudhive slowly lifts into the sky and then retreats in the direction of the old growth forest to the south.</p><p>A great cheer rises up from the scattered crowd. The festival is saved.</p></blockquote><p>Return each Cloudhive and Cloudhive Swarm in play, in the path deck, and in the path discard to the collection.

As the sound persists, you get the impression that the bees of the cloudhive are in something of a discussion. Then, as if called to action, the bees infesting the grounds take to the sky and begin to gather around the hive.</p><p>Soon the hive becomes nearly invisible behind dark clouds of swarming bees. The sound of buzzing builds to a crescendo as the cloudhive raises high into the air, and eventually becomes all but lost in the clouds.</p><p>A great cheer rises up from the scattered  crowd. The festival is saved.</p></blockquote><p>Return each Cloudhive and Cloudhive Swarm in play, in the path deck, and in the path discard to the collection.
