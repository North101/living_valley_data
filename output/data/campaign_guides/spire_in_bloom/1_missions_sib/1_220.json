You fix your eyes onto hers and perceive the embers of rage burning behind them. You take slow, measured breaths, keeping your heart rate steady as you draw closer, and as you do she seems to recognize that you're here to help.</p><p>She plops onto her rear with a grumble, and you very slowly reach for the kinetic glass shard embedded in her paw. It's wedged in pretty tight, and seems to be pulsing in the wound, but with some effort and careful timing, you manage to pull it out.</p><p>With a satisfied grunt, Deadfall rolls onto all fours, shakes her mountain of a body, and trots off. Now that the shard's been removed, you're confident that the wound will heal, and that Deadfall's temperament will improve.</p><p>You turn the kinetic glass shard over in your hands, examining it closely. The glass is cracked, but it's razor-sharp and still highly mutable. Perhaps you can find a use for it.</p></blockquote><p>Complete the <b>TRACKING DESTRUCTION (DEADFALL)</b> mission. Return Deadfall to the collection and permanently remove her from the Valley set. Each Ranger soothes 2 fatigue. Gain the Adaptive Glass Shard reward card, placing 4 checkmarks next to it. You have unlocked that many copies of this reward card.</p>",
