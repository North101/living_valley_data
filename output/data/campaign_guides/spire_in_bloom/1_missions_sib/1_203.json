Normally I wouldn't need the help, but something's got the cloudhive bees in a stir, and I don't want to take any chances. In any event, it should be a short journey to Brookside. I'm ready to leave when you are!\"</p></blockquote><p>Search the Spire Crossing set for Raemon, Caravaneer and put him into play (do not read his entry). Add 4 additional supplies to Raemon.</p><p>Flip <mission>SUPPLY RUN</mission> to its <mission>RETURN TRIP</mission> side, but don't update your campaign tracker. If you don't complete the mission today, you will have to meet with Raemon again in White Sky.</p>",
