  "content": "<blockquote id=\"narration_1\"><p>The signs of Deadfall's rampage are readily apparent: trees with broken limbs lean to the left and the right of the trampled underbrush that marks her passage. Something has gotten her riled up, that much is for certain. But what?</p><p>Just then, you hear a low growl. You peek through the brush and spot the Great Ursus sitting with her back to a tree, gnawing at one of her hind paws. From your vantage point, you can clearly see the problem: a shard of kinetic glass from Tollin's broken scupture is embedded in her paw, no doubt causing her a great deal of pain.</p><p>As you come to this realization, she spots you, rolling back onto her feet and moving toward you with an angry growl. Your heart races. Wounded or not, she's still one of the most powerful and dangerous beings in the Valley.</p><p>You think, perhaps, if you can get close enough, you might be able to remove the shard of glass from her paw\u2014assuming she will allow it, of course. As if in response, Deadfall rears onto her hind legs, as tall as an oak, and lets out a blood-curdling roar. </p></blockquote><p>Flip the <mission>TRACKING DESTRUCTION</mission> mission over to its <mission>STOP THE RAMPAGE</mission> side, but don't update your campaign tracker. If you don't stop Deadfall's rampage today, you will have to track her down again.</p><p>Search the path deck and discard pile for Deadfall and put her into play. Do not read her entry. Return all set-aside features to the collection.</p>",
