We took our usual route, making note of the Terravore's position and marking its progress, but while we were there, a rumbling from deep underground stopped us in our tracks. Normally I wouldn't be rattled by such an event\u2014we've all felt tremors from time to time. But this gave me pause because I could swear it was coming from the Terravore itself, or perhaps just beneath it.</i></p><p><i>Might you be able to convince Elder Thrush to send a patrol into the Terravore to discern the cause? I would ask her myself, but I think that I may have lost some sway with her after the infamous bearsloth debacle, and an excursion into the mouth of the Terravore would be far more dangerous to say the least.</i></p><p><i>\u2013 Sirisana</i></p></blockquote>",
