  "content": "<blockquote id=\"narration_1\"><p>As you navigate the bustling docks, you find yourself watching the dockworkers go about their business, loading and unloading skiffs and seed barges. For a moment, you set aside the urgency of your task and daydream about where each boat might have come from, and where they might be headed next.</p><p>\"It's not polite to stare, you know,\" a man's voice calls out to you from behind. You turn to face a well-built, muscular man with a hard expression, no doubt earned by years of working the docks, carrying heavy loads. You apologize and tell him that you were merely lost in thought.</p><p>\"Well, I've had enough of a day without you standing in the way gawking,\" he says with a scowl, pushing you aside so he can reach his seed barge. He loads a crate of carbon-forged fishing gear onto the boat and you make yourself scarce, though you can't help but wonder what's got his feathers ruffled.</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear Bo with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to ask why he's upset.</i></p>",
