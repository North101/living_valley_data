She wants to be a Ranger like you.</p><p>\"We haven't talked since that day. It\u2026wasn't pretty. I said some harsh things I'm not proud of.\" He runs his hand through his hair and sighs. \"I tried to apologize. I sent her a letter, but the courier came back to let me know that he'd lost it along the way. Said he was attacked by veloxes and his parcels all fell out of his satchel as he ran.\"</p><p>You ask why he doesn't try to send another letter, and he shakes his head. \"You don't understand. It has to be that letter,\" he says stubbornly. \"It's\u2026special.\" Perhaps if you find Bo's letter, you can deliver it for him.</p></blockquote><p color=\"red\">A) Agree to find Bo's missing letter.</p><blockquote id=\"narration_2\"><p>You tell Bo that you'll look for his letter and deliver it yourself.
