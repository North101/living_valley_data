  "content": "<blockquote id=\"narration_1\"><p>You tell Bo that you found and delivered his letter, and that Olyv wants to talk to him. His eyes go wide, and his usual hard expression softens as Olyv emerges from around the corner. You back up, giving the two some\u00a0space.</p><p>For a moment, you think neither of them is going to speak. Then Olyv breaks the silence. \"I\u2026I got your letter,\" she says, quiet as a\u00a0mouse.</p><p>Bo doesn't look her in the eyes, instead focusing his gaze on a thin carbonforged chain around Olyv's neck. A familiar tortoise pendant dangles on the end. \"Olyv, I\u2026\"</p><p>\"Don't,\" Olyv cuts him off. \"You were right. We had all these plans, and I ruined everything.\"</p><p>\"You didn't ruin anything,\" Bo says, gesturing toward the docks. \"See? I'm piloting a seed barge, just like I always wanted. When you told me you wanted to join the Rangers, I was selfish and cruel. I was hurt, and I was just a big dumb idiot. I should have been happy for you. I should have said, 'Good for you!' But I didn't, and I haven't been able to live with myself since. Olyv, are you\u2026happy?\"</p><p>\"I wish I could say that I was,\" Olyv confesses, tears in her eyes. \"I love being a Ranger, but I haven't been able to live with myself either! I miss you, Bo. I miss our friendship.\" She steps forward slowly, cautiously, the space between them seeming infinite at first. Then Bo closes the gap and sweeps her into a crushing hug.</p><p>\"I missed you so much,\" Bo says, his voice choked as the two embrace. You quietly step away and give the reunited friends some space.</p></blockquote><p>Discard Bo and Olyv. Each Ranger soothes 4 fatigue. Gain the <reward>True Friendship</reward> reward card.
