  "content": "<p>Welcome to <b><i>Spire in Bloom</i></b>, the first valley expansion for Earthborne Rangers. Valley expansions do exactly that: they expand the Valley by adding new locations and paths to explore, people to meet, missions to accomplish, and rewards to unlock.</p><p>This section only includes the campaign guide entries for the <b><i>Spire in Bloom</i></b> expansion. It is not a comprehensive campaign guide that includes all of <b><i>Lure of the Valley</i></b>. You may have to switch back and forth between the Lure of the Valley entries and these entries as needed.</p><h1 id=\"getting-started\">Getting Started</h1><p>Valley expansions can be incorporated into any <b><i>Lure of the Valley</i></b> campaign (the campaign included in the Earthborne Rangers base game). Choose one of the following options based on how you want to incorporate this expansion into your campaign and follow the instructions:</p><ul><li><b>I'm starting a new Lure of the Valley campaign:</b> First, add the cards from this expansion to their corresponding sets from the core game and replace the original Spire location card with the new Spire location card. Then, start a new campaign using the Getting Started section on page 9 of the rulebook. Finally, record <span color=\"blue\">216.1</span> above any perfect day on the day track (we recommend day eight).</li><li><b>I am in the middle of (or have completed) Lure of the Valley:</b> First, add the cards from this expansion to their corresponding sets from the core game and replace the original Spire location card with the new Spire location card. Finally, record <span color=\"blue\">216.1</span> above any perfect day on the day track (we recommend day eight, or the next perfect day on the day track if it is already past day eight).</li></ul><h1 id=\"campaign-expansions\">Campaign Expansions</h1><p>While valley expansions cannot be fully integrated into campaign expansions (such as <b><i>Legacy of the Ancestors</i></b>) for a variety of reasons, some of the new content in this expansion may be used even while playing a campaign expansion. Additionally, if you have completed a campaign expansion, you can return to the Valley after the events of that campaign to continue exploring and play through the new content in this expansion. Choose one of the following options based on how you want to incorporate this expansion into your campaign and follow the instructions:</p><ul><li><b>I am playing a campaign expansion:</b>\u00a0Add the cards from this expansion to their corresponding sets from the core game. Not all of this content will be available in the campaign you are playing, but some (like the Valley set) may appear in that campaign. If the campaign you are playing includes the Spire location, use the original Spire location card, not the new one included in this expansion. Use the map included in the campaign expansion.</li><li><b>I am returning to the Valley after completing a campaign expansion:</b> First, add the cards from this expansion to their corresponding sets from the core game and replace the original Spire location card with the new Spire location card. Then, return to your Lure of the Valley campaign tracker and resume from the last day you left off. (If\u00a0you did not play Lure of the Valley, create a new campaign tracker for that campaign, record <mission>THE VALLEY'S SECRETS</mission> mission on it, and cross off entries <span color=\"blue\">1</span>, <span color=\"blue\">94.1</span>, and <span color=\"blue\">1.04</span> on its day tracker.) Begin at Lone Tree Station, using the Woods terrain set. Finally, record <span color=\"blue\">216.1</span> above any perfect day on the day track (we recommend day eight, or the next perfect day on the day track if it is already past day\u00a0eight).</li></ul>",
