The device that held the kinetic glass in stasis is still functional, which explains the floating glass. A few flecks of dried blood on a larger piece confirm your earlier suspicion. A living being did this\u2014a big one. Just then, you hear a voice call out from behind you. \"In case you're wondering, it was a model of Spire,\" the voice says.</p><p>You turn to face Tollin Lang, Spire's resident sculptor. He carries a bundle of sculpting tools\u2014no doubt hoping to clean up this mess or restore his creation. You ask what happened, and he looks at you with a troubled expression.</p><p>\"It was the Great Ursus! A group of teens came to tell me that they saw it happen. And they were laughing! Laughing! The nerve!\" Tollin exclaims. \"The hunters call her 'Deadfall.' They say she's so big she can knock down a tree just by looking at it! Ridiculous. Well, she did more than look at my beautiful sculpture, that's for sure. Can you believe it? There's no accounting for taste.\"</p><p>You've heard the stories. From what you know, Deadfall is enormous, easily twice the size of the average adult ursus. She could trample right over a dolewood sapling and barely feel the impact. If she's on a rampage, it could spell trouble for the entire Valley.</p></blockquote><choice id=\"rangers-choose\">RANGERS CHOOSE</choice><p color=\"red\">A) Resolve to track down Deadfall, the Great Ursus.</p><p>Gain the <b>TRACKING DESTRUCTION (DEADFALL)</b> mission. <i>(Reminder: search the Valley set for Deadfall and attach her facedown to the mission card.)</i> Discard Broken Sculpture.</p><p color=\"red\">B) Another time, perhaps.</p><p>Discard Broken Sculpture.
