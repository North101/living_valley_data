Whatever this sculpture once was, it's impossible to tell now. It's difficult to see from this distance, but if you had to guess, it looks like it was trampled by something enormous. You'll have to get closer to investigate further.</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear the Broken Sculpture with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> while each Ranger's <icon icon=\"ranger_token\">&nbsp;</icon> is on it to get a closer look, or simply clear it with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to pass it by.</i></p>",
