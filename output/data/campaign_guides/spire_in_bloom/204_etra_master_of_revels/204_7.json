Why, I remember meeting a Ranger on the path when I was just a boy. She stopped by say hello, and then offered me a biscuit. It was a little stale, but I remember it being quite delicious all the same.\" Etra looks off, wistfully, then returns his attention to you. \"As a matter of fact\u2026here,\" he says, gesturing toward the basket. \"Please. I insist!\"</p><p>You pluck a sweet roll from the basket and give thanks. Etra beams with delight, then departs with a wave.</p></blockquote><p>Discard Etra. Each Ranger may either soothe 2\u00a0fatigue, or spend any amount of energy of one aspect to gain that much energy of another aspect.</p>",
