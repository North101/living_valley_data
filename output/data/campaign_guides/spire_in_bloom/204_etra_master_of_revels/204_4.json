If you can find enough people who agree with you, then I will concede the point, but for now, my decision stands. Now, if you'll excuse me, I am expected at the Forge\u2026\" With that, Elder Orlin walks off brusquely, and you watch as Etra is left to sit with his thoughts.</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear Etra with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to ask what the problem is.</i></p>",
