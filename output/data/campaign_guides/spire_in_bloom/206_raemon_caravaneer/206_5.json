You tell Raemon that it's about time he took a well-earned break. Work is important, but our bodies and minds need time to rest and recuperate, too. He nods along, rolling his eyes but smiling despite himself. \"I know, I know. You're right\u2014a wisdom older than the Elders themselves. Well, lead the way, then!\"</p><p>You get a round of drinks and sit together in the open courtyard. A talespinner sits in a nearby corner, strumming a quiet tune on his lute. Raemon leans back in his chair, takes a few sips of honey mead, and breathes a sigh of relief. \"I have to admit, I needed this. Thank you for taking the time to bring me here. I appreciate it.\"</p><p>He raises his flagon and you clink yours against it. \"To the Rangers,\" he says. You make a toast of your own, and together you sit in silence while the worries of the day float away like leaves in the autumn breeze.</p></blockquote><p>Discard Raemon and return <mission>HELPING HAND</mission> to the collection. Each Ranger soothes 2 fatigue. Record <event>SHARED A DRINK</event> on the campaign tracker.</p>",
