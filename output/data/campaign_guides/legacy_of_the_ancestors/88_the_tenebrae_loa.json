  "content": "<blockquote><p>As you walk the path, you suddenly feel a tingling chill run over your skin, as if thousands of tiny spiders were delicately plucking at the hairs of your body. </p><p>It is then that you realize you\u2019ve been surrounded by looming, shadowy shapes. The bulbous tenebrae hang in the air, their drapery of tendrils waving slowly, caught in some invisible current. You jump back as one emerges from thin air right in front of you, as if it drifted out from behind a curtain. The tendrils move toward your face \u2026 only to fade again to nothing before they touch. </p><p>You watch them drift and sway, seemingly phasing in and out of existence, sometimes near, sometimes far. You wonder at their nature. Are they truly creations of the ancestors, or something else entirely?</p></blockquote>",
