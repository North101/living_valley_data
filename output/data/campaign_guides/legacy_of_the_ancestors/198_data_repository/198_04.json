  "content": "<blockquote><p>These entries seem to be what you\u2019ve been looking for. The first section contains a series of logs detailing spindlescuttler excavation efforts and describing how these have proven much more useful than other methods. Ral caustically notes that the success of the spindlescuttlers has finally shut down attempts to dig the caverns using \u201cquark waveform detonations\u201d and their \u201conly .1% chance of unleashing a cascading collapse that would destroy all of Colorado.\u201d </p><p>It seems like the Estians were in a hurry to construct Vista (which you think is the name they gave the Arcology) because of worsening lightning storms. The spindlescuttlers were essential to dig out the arcology, even as a massive reservoir was excavated just beyond the Bitter Pass, at the head of the Silverfin, to capture the excessive rain and prevent the Valley from flooding. A hydroelectric dam was then constructed to supply the arcology with power. </p><p>Several entries later, you find the first references to the arcology needing more power than the dam could provide, and the development of some sort of \u201cperpetual biofusion reactor\u201d being grown for eventual installation in the arcology\u2019s depths. Later references refer to the reactor being given autonomous control over Vista\u2019s various mechanical systems. </p><p>The later entries you find seem to be concerned with resources being devoted towards two competing projects that were taking up more and more attention within Vista. The entries don\u2019t say what those projects are, but you do find their names. One is the Arbol Initiative. The other is the Mycelium Distributed Cognition Network. There are also entries referring to arguments between the supporters of each, and some strong arguments about the dangers of the Arbol Initiative. </p><p>The final entry is a transcript of an emergency broadcast across Vista\u2019s systems. The dam at the head of the Valley suffered a catastrophic explosion due to a sudden, massive surge of energy. In a moment, the entire contents of the reservoir beyond the dam burst forth. Your blood runs cold as you imagine the implacable wall of water rushing toward the arcology, destroying everything in its path. There would have been no escape.</p></blockquote><p>Gain The Ambition of the Estians reward card.</p>",
