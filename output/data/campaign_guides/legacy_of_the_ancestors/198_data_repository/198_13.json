  "content": "<blockquote><p>You uncover a \u201cguardian protocol\u201d relating to the Arboretum of Memory. The protocol talks about the various security measures put in place to defend the trees and the information stored within them. These measures are physical, electronic, and even psychological (although you\u2019re not sure what that means). </p><p>It looks like most of these security measures must have failed or shut down over the centuries (otherwise, your attempts to access the Arboretum would have been a lot more exciting). But the interesting element is just how important the Estians considered the Arboretum of Memory. It served as the data archives for the entirety of Vista while also storing so much information from the ancient world. Although the sheer amount of information makes searching for specifics problematic, you know that you hold the entire history of the Estians in your hands.</p></blockquote>",
