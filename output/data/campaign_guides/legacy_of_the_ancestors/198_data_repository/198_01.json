Quickly, you realize you\u2019ve uncovered a wealth of information about the first days of the arcology\u2019s construction. </p></blockquote><p>Each Ranger may soothe 1 fatigue. If you are on <b>TO THE HEART OF IT</b> and have not gained or completed <b>CONTACT NAL</b>, continue reading:</p><blockquote><p>As you read word after word of densely packed text, your eyes grow tired. The words swim before your eyes, and you begin to nod off. Then you see \u2026 or maybe you hear \u2026 someone at the edge of your perception. </p><p>In a moment of lucid dreaming, you suddenly see Spirit Speaker Nal standing before you. She speaks, but you can't make out the words. At that moment, another quake rumbles through the chamber, and you snap back awake. The vision fades.</p><p>You know that Nal does not reach out to Rangers in the field on a whim. Whatever she has to say must be important. Perhaps, if you could quiet your mind, you might strengthen your connection with her and receive a clearer message.</p></blockquote><p>Gain the <b>CONTACT NAL</b> mission.</p>",
