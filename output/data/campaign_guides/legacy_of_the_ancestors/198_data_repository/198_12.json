You realize that the Sphere was not only a place of experimentation; it also was capable of mass-producing biomelds and other bio-engineered creations. In essence, it was a biological factory that could populate thousands of square kilometers with plants and animals in a few short years. The various biomelds created here include many of the biomeld species found in the Valley (particularly spindlescuttlers, hydraworms, and puffercrawlers), as well as ones you\u2019ve never heard of (such as a species referred to only as \"the descendants\").</p></blockquote>",
