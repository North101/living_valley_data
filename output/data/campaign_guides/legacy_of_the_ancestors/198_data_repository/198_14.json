There is mention of the Cage in the deepest part of the arcology (mostly in reference to how hard it was to excavate), but any references to what that chamber was for have been lost. However, peculiarly, the record notes that <span color=\"blue\">MACHINES</span> were used to excavate the Cage, poorly, before the Estians introduced a biomeld that could do the job instead. That information might be useful for identifying information specific to the Cage.</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Blue text may be useful to you.
