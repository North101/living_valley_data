You note how the entry mentions some sort of biomeld called a Scuttler Metrobus. Based on the references, you infer that the biomelds traveled through the transit arteries, and the arcology denizens must have ridden them somehow. </p><p>You also notice that one of the transit arteries runs south out of the Valley and beneath the Verdessa. It seems to be the only artery that runs outside of the arcology proper.</p></blockquote>",
