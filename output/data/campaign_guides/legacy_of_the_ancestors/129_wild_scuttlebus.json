The smaller glass portals and hatchways embedded in its chitinous carapace confirm your suspicions: This being used to be some sort of living transit system for the Estians! </p><p>Now, of course, it just wants to eat you. </p></blockquote><p>Record <event>ENCOUNTERED THE SCUTTLEBUS</event> on the campaign tracker.</p><p>If you have <event>STAGED THE HUNT</event>, go to <a href=\"campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/129_wild_scuttlebus/129_1\"><entry>129.1</entry></a>.
