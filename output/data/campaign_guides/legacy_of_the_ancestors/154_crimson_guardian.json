The sound of heavy footsteps precedes a hulking form that all but fills the passageway.</p><p>It stops, and projects several thin, red bands of light that seem to scan its surroundings. You stand stock-still as the lights move across your body. First horizontally, then vertically. Then, suddenly, the machine turns, and a powerful, blood red light shines upon you.</p></blockquote>",
