This passageway, however, is the darkest you have seen. It\u2019s as though it emanates darkness, projecting it outward to swallow the light. There could be any number of dangers within. You stand before the opening, knowing that you must enter, but hesitant to do so.</p></blockquote><p><i><span color=\"blue\">Clear the Pitch Black Passage with <span><icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon></span> while each Ranger\u2019s <span><icon icon=\"ranger_token\">&nbsp;</icon></span> is on it to overcome your fear of the unknown.</span></i></p>",
