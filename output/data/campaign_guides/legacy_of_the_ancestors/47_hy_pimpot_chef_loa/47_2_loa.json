  "content": "<blockquote><p>The rich aroma of meaty smoke fills your nostrils as you come up a staircase and find Hy Pimpot on his balcony. Long strips of sitka deer meat have been stretched across a drying rack, and below it, a low, smoldering fire sends up pungent clouds to slowly smoke the meat into preserved jerky. </p><p>Hy is carefully flipping one of the strips of meat when he sees you. He waves, then gives you a mock scowl. \u201cWell, well! I know what you\u2019ve come around for,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the jerky isn\u2019t ready yet! You\u2019ll have to come back later, you bunch of hungry scrofs!\u201d He waves his finger in admonishment, and you can\u2019t help but burst out laughing at his comically exaggerated gesture.</p></blockquote><p><i><p class=\"text text_blue\">You can help Hy Pimpot by gathering ingredients for his traditional stew, or you can clear him with <span><icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon></span> to ask if he has any new recipes.</p></i></p>",
