  "content": "<blockquote id=\"narration_1\"><p>The rich aroma of meaty smoke fills your nostrils as you come up a staircase and find Hy Pimpot on his balcony. Long strips of sitka deer meat have been stretched across a drying rack, and below it, a low, smoldering fire sends up pungent clouds to slowly smoke the meat into preserved jerky. </p><p>Hy is carefully flipping one of the strips of meat when he sees you. He waves, then gives you a mock scowl. \"Well, well! I know what you've come around for,\" he says. \"But the jerky isn't ready yet! You'll have to come back later, you bunch of hungry scrofs!\" He waves his finger in admonishment, and you can't help but burst out laughing at his comically exaggerated gesture.</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>You can help Hy Pimpot by gathering ingredients for his traditional stew, or you can clear him with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to ask if he has any new recipes.</i></p>",
