He smiles. \"Well, I have to admit that ever since Silaro started going on about his great expedition into the arcology, it's gotten me thinking about all the mushrooms that must be down there. The fungi you can find up here in the Valley are just fine, of course, but just think of all the different species you could find down in those tunnels! Why, I bet I could make a stew entirely out of mushrooms, and it would be the best thing you've ever tasted!\" </p><p>You agree that it could be possible and speak of other things. However, this idea clearly has hooked Hy. Finally he looks up at you, his eyes clear and bright. \"You know, I don't think I can pass up this opportunity. Would you accompany me down into the arcology, so I can make for you the greatest mushroom stew ever created?\" </p></blockquote><p><b color=\"red\">A) Absolutely!</b> Discard all <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> and attach the <mission>HELPING HAND</mission> mission to Hy Pimpot. <i color=\"blue\">Make a stew with Hy Pimpot's test using only cards with the Mycelial keyword.</i></p><p><b color=\"red\">B) Some other time.</b> Discard Hy Pimpot.
