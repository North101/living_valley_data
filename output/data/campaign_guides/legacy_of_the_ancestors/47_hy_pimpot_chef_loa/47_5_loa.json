  "content": "<blockquote><p>Hy can barely contain his excitement as he cleans and prepares the colorful and varied mushrooms you\u2019ve gathered. He sets a pot upon a single Sol coil and fills it with water sprinkled with herbs. Soon the broth is boiling, and he adds the mushrooms, each type, at seemingly predetermined moments. After what feels like an eternity, the stew is ready. It smells both earthy and delicious. As you go to take a bite, Hy clears his throat. \u201cJust to warn you,\u201d he says. \u201cThese mushrooms are not for the faint of heart. I\u2019d be willing to bet that they might have something of a \u2026 mind expanding effect.\u201d</p></blockquote><choice id=\"rangers-choose\">RANGERS CHOOSE</choice><p><b><span color=\"red\">A) Down the hatch!</span></b> Go to <a href=\"#475a\">47.5a</a>.</p><p><b><span color=\"red\">B) On second thought, I need to keep my wits about me.</span></b> Discard each flora attached to Hy Pimpot.

You don\u2019t feel anything at first, but shortly after you finish your bowl, a strange sensation comes over you. It\u2019s like your feet are sinking into the earth at the same time that your head is rising above the clouds that flow over the Valley. You look down, and you see the Valley and the arcology as it must have been thousands of years ago. The Fractured Wall is whole again, with a vast lake behind it. In place of Spire is a glimmering structure, glowing blue-white with the energies flowing to it from the Concordant Ziggurats. And, beneath the surface, you can somehow feel the many tunnels stretching out to all corners of the Valley, and far below them, a beating heart.</p><p>After what could have been mere moments, or could have been a day, you open your eyes. You are sitting back at Hy Pimpot\u2019s portable kitchen, an empty stew bowl in your hand. The gnomish little chef looks over at you, his eyes wide and smiling. He shows you his own empty bowl. You and he share a long, hearty laugh, then settle back, enjoying your new perspective on life and the history of the Valley. </p></blockquote><p>Discard each flora attached to Hy Pimpot.
