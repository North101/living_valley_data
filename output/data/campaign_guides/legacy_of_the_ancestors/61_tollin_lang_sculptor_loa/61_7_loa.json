I can make maquettes\u2014scale models\u2014and then the artificers can turn them into pulleys, collapsible shelters, archaeological scaffolding, you name it. It\u2019s been an absolutely fantastic challenge!\u201d </p><p>\u201cIn any case, I hope you\u2019ll put my designs to good use down in the arcology! I wish you all the best.\u201d </p></blockquote><p>Discard Tollin. Search the Spire deck for the Arcology Threshold and put it into play.</p>",
