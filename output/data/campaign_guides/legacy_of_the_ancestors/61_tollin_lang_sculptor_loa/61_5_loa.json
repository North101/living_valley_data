Ever since I was able to install my masterpiece on the Stoneweaver Bridge, I've been experimenting with new subjects, and even some new materials!\" He points at the collection of plates he's assembled. \"This, for instance, is going to be a musical instrument!\"</p><p>You ask him what kind of instrument he's making, and his smile turns a bit sheepish. \"Well, I'm not sure yet. It's all flowsteel, so it can take whatever shape we want it to. But while I was toying around, I did notice that the size, shape and concavity all change the note produced when struck. See, listen!\"</p><p>He strikes one of the plates with a metal rod, and it resounds in a hideous note that makes your entire body cringe. \"In any case, I'm really happy to see you,\" Tollin continues. \"You see, I'm skilled at creating things, but I'm not exactly musically inclined. I can shape each of these plates to produce a specific note, but I have no idea how to tune it as a whole. Perhaps you'd be willing to help me shape these plates into a workable instrument? It might take a while, though\u2014I'll understand if you're busy!\" </p></blockquote><p><b color=\"red\">A) Help Tollin tune his prototype instrument.</b> Discard all <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> from Tollin and attach <mission>HELPING HAND</mission>.
