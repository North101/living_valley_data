I've been spending every spare moment helping to rebuild Spire. Apparently,\" he smiles and looks a little embarrassed, \"my ability to quickly construct maquettes is very useful when we need to figure out how to rebuild a structure. It's what's gotten me interested in sculpting Estian architecture, actually.\" </p><p>\"In any case, I've heard you're going down below to help explore the arcology! That sounds fascinating! I wish you all the best.\" </p></blockquote><p>Discard Tollin. Each Ranger soothes 2 fatigue. Search the Spire deck for the Arcology Threshold and put it into play. Then, each Ranger may place their Ranger token on it.</p>",
