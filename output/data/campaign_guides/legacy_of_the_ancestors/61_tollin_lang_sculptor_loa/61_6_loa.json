I\u2019ve been spending every spare moment helping to rebuild Spire. Apparently,\u201d he smiles and looks a little embarrassed, \u201cmy ability to quickly construct maquettes is very useful when we need to figure out how to rebuild a structure. It\u2019s what\u2019s gotten me interested in sculpting Estian architecture, actually.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIn any case, I\u2019ve heard you\u2019re going down below to help explore the arcology! That sounds fascinating! I wish you all the best.\u201d </p></blockquote><p>Discard Tollin. Each Ranger soothes 2 fatigue. Search the Spire deck for the Arcology Threshold and put it into play. Then, each Ranger may place their Ranger token on it.</p>",
