  "content": "<blockquote><p>With your keen ear to help guide Tollin\u2019s hand, you painstakingly tune each individual plate of flowsteel so that it sounds a specific note when struck. Tollin then arranges each plate by note, keeping them suspended by magnetic resonance. By the time you are done, the device in front of you is a curving, twisting array of flowsteel suspended about a foot off the ground.</p><p>At that moment, drawn by the sound of music, Elder Orlin approaches and watches you practice. \u201cIs that a lithophone made out of \u2026 flowsteel?\u201d she asks in amazement.</p><p>\u201cIt is!\u201d Tollin says proudly. \u201cI believe I\u2019ve outdone myself this time, although I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do it without the help of my friend here,\u201d he explains, motioning to you. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019d like you to keep it.\u201d He steps aside and presents the lithophone to you.</p><p>When you ask if he\u2019s sure he wants to give up his new invention, Tollin grins. \u201cMy artistic skills lie exclusively in physical media,\u201d he says. \u201cBelieve me, you don\u2019t want to hear me play this! There\u2019s a reason I asked for your help tuning it. Just ask my childhood lute instructor!\u201d </p></blockquote><p>Gain the Flowsteel Lithophone reward card. Discard Tollin and return <b>HELPING HAND</b> to the collection. Return the 5 Aspect cards used to create the lithophone and each energy token above them to the collection. Record <span class=\"text text_blue\">TUNED THE LITHOPHONE</span> on the campaign tracker.</p>",
