  "content": "<blockquote id=\"narration_1\"><p>With your keen ear to help guide Tollin's hand, you painstakingly tune each individual plate of flowsteel so that it sounds a specific note when struck. Tollin then arranges each plate by note, keeping them suspended by magnetic resonance. By the time you are done, the device in front of you is a curving, twisting array of flowsteel suspended about a foot off the ground.</p><p>At that moment, drawn by the sound of music, Elder Orlin approaches and watches you practice. \"Is that a lithophone made out of \u2026 flowsteel?\" she asks in amazement.</p><p>\"It is!\" Tollin says proudly. \"I believe I've outdone myself this time, although I wouldn't have been able to do it without the help of my friend here,\" he explains, motioning to you. \"In fact, I'd like you to keep it.\" He steps aside and presents the lithophone to you.</p><p>When you ask if he's sure he wants to give up his new invention, Tollin grins. \"My artistic skills lie exclusively in physical media,\" he says. \"Believe me, you don't want to hear me play this! There's a reason I asked for your help tuning it. Just ask my childhood lute instructor!\" </p></blockquote><p>Gain the <reward>Flowsteel Lithophone</reward> reward card. Discard Tollin and return <mission>HELPING HAND</mission> to the collection. Return the 5 Aspect cards used to create the lithophone and each energy token above them to the collection.
