For each aspect whose value is the same on both of the struck cards, take an unused energy token of that aspect and place it above the lithophone. Then, flip both struck cards facedown, keeping them in the same order. If there is at least one energy token for each of the four aspects above the lithophone, the lithophone is tuned.
