  "content": "<blockquote id=\"narration_1\"><p>Although the arcology's designers clearly had worked to blend form and function in their architecture, the hallways you find yourself in have a markedly utilitarian cast. Rust-frozen gravlifters dangle from low ceilings, and your footsteps echo off the bare metal floor. In places, the walls have collapsed in piles of rubble, and in other chambers you catch the musty whiff of the strange fungi that infest these depths. Even so, you can tell these were once workshops and manufacturing centers. It seems that much of what was created down here was done through automation, in stark contrast to the residents of the Valley today, who work by hand and rely only on their own craft.</p><p>Among the detritus and debris, you catch the glint of metal and carbonforged alloy beneath mounds of rock and mushrooms. Perhaps you might find something useful if you search here.</p></blockquote><p>If you traveled here from Branching Artery, go to <a href=\"campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/158_locked_passage/158_2\"><entry>158.2</entry></a>.</p><p>Otherwise, go to <a href=\"campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/158_locked_passage/158_1\"><entry>158.1</entry></a>.</p>",
