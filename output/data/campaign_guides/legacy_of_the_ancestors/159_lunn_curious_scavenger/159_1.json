Beside him sits a backpack bursting with supplies from every pouch and pocket. \u201cOh!\u201d Lunn yells, startled. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to run into anyone else out and about, what with everyone congregating at the Chimney and all. What a pleasant surprise!\u201d</p><p>He beckons you closer. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking. Who\u2019s watching over the Northern Outpost if I\u2019m down here in this hole? Well don\u2019t you worry about it,\u201d he says with a wave of his hand. \u201cI\u2019ve been stationed in that dark old forest for years. It practically takes care of itself! Besides, I wasn\u2019t about to sit around while everyone else was off exploring the arcology. Imagine all the Estian gadgets sitting in the dark, collecting dust, just waiting to be found!\u201d</p><p>Lunn gestures to his overstuffed pack. \u201cYou never know what you\u2019ll need out in the wilderness, let alone in this strange, subterranean maze. Why just a few days ago, a little deeper in, I found a completely flooded passage. Couldn't get through no way no how, but then I remembered the devices I got from Ren Kobo a few years ago\u2014devices that let you breathe underwater! Imagine that! I ran back to the Outpost and dug them out of storage. Got \u2018em right here \u2026 somewhere \u2026\u201d</p></blockquote><p><i><span class=\"text text_blue\">Clear Lunn with <span><icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon></span> to ask him about the devices.</span></i></p>",
