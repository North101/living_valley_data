Estian no less!\" he says, producing a small case of brown, lacquered wood from his pack. Inside are several intricately crafted collars.</p><p>\"I went to the Golden Shore to give them a try. Ren Kobo warned me that they were running low on juice, and he wasn't wrong! After about a minute of breathing easy as can be, the thing stopped working. I had to swim for my life!\" He shakes his head. \"You know me. I love to tinker! But I couldn't get it to work with our power cells. I thought maybe I'd find something down here that could help. It runs on the quantumly entangled photons contained in these little glass cubes the Estians were fond of. Let's call them 'quantum cubes' for short. I've found some in the rubble, but so far they're all either dead or broken.\"</p><p>Lunn lifts a collar from the case. \"You know what?\" he says. \"I think you should take them with you. Usually, I'd want something in trade, but the universe conspired for us to cross paths here in this isolated sinkhole, and I have a feeling this is the reason.\" He hands you the case and gathers his pack. \"You're sure to find some of those cubes on your journey. Just keep your eyes open for piles of rubble. Once you do, just insert the cube into this here socket, and it should power right up!\"</p></blockquote><p>Gain the <mission>BREATHE EASIER</mission> mission. Discard Lunn. Each Ranger soothes 2 fatigue.</p>",
