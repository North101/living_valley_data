He sighs as you approach. \u201cAh, hello. I\u2019m trying to trace the power leads from the ziggurats above to see if we can shut them down or even moderate them. I was hoping to quell some of the quakes, but no luck. How have your travels gone?\u201d</p><p>You explain what you have learned about the expedition and its fate, and Silaro\u2019s eyes go wide. \u201cBy the ancestors, I wasn\u2019t sure what you\u2019d find, but this is fascinating! Please, start at the beginning and leave nothing out!\u201d</p><p>So over the next few hours, you do just that, with Silaro taking copious notes and interrupting you several times for clarification. As you finish, he sits back, the worry in his face temporarily erased with fascination. </p><p>\u201cThen we finally know what happened to Hollan and her team. We had long assumed that they had passed on, but it seems at least one of them is still alive! Hm, if the remains in that inverted forest are the scout Xavi, the presence in the mycelial network must be Yara. I guess she learned far more about those mushrooms than she expected. The cloak you spotted in the scuttlebus\u2019s teeth is probably Hollan herself. That means the survivor is Timo. It seems that he preferred the company of the machines and ruins to that of people on the surface. Can't say there aren't days I feel similarly, but I don't know if I'd take it to that extreme!\u201d</p><p>The fascination has faded, replaced with sadness. Silaro sighs. \u201cIn the end, they underestimated the dangers down here, and each went alone to be consumed by them. A good lesson for us all to learn from.\u201d </p></blockquote><p>Discard Silaro Mako. Each Ranger soothes 3 fatigue. Complete <b>THE EXPEDITION'S PATH</b> mission.

Any detail could be crucial!\u201d </p><p>You spend a few minutes updating Silaro on what you\u2019ve learned. As you get up to leave, you see him turn back to his work with a bit more of a spring in his step.</p></blockquote><p>Discard Silaro Mako. Each Ranger soothes 2 fatigue.</p>",
