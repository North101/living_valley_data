  "content": "<blockquote><p>Silaro hands the book to you. \u201cAn interesting find, to be sure,\u201d he says. \u201cThis was bound by Dorrin Qur, one of the last he made before he passed five summers ago. Old Dorrin made a set for the Hollan Expedition, though it\u2019s remembered now only as the 'Lost Expedition.' Hollan Helgur organized a team of would-be explorers\u2014including some Rangers\u2014and ventured into the depths of the arcology, never to return.\u201d</p><p>You recall Elder Thrush\u2019s description of that ill-fated expedition. You had thought that no trace of them was ever found; and you say as much to Silaro. </p><p>The archaeologist nods, and you catch a glimpse of Silaro\u2019s old enthusiasm beneath his somber demeanor. \u201cCorrect you are, and many of us spent our fair share of time looking. But as I searched the maze-like corridors to the north of here, I came across this in the midst of what appeared to be an old campsite.\u201d</p><p>Silaro leans closer and opens the book, pointing to several entries in turn. \u201cIt\u2019s incomplete, and there\u2019s been some damage. But this is definitely the expedition\u2019s logbook! I think if I review the entries and crosscheck them with some of the things we\u2019ve discovered in the last few days \u2026\u201d His voice trails off, and the brief enthusiasm fades. \u201cBut I fear I have no time to investigate this further at the moment, intriguing as it may be.\u201d</p><p>You do not hesitate to offer your assistance, and suggest that if Silaro doesn\u2019t have time to follow up on this, you just might. After all, you reason, once you review the logbook, it won\u2019t be too difficult for you to keep an eye out for clues as to the expedition\u2019s fate. </p><p>Silaro thinks for a moment, then to your surprise, grabs you in an awkward but genuine hug. \u201cThank you,\u201d he says, his voice husky. \u201cI\u2019ll give you the book and eagerly await what you learn.\u201d </p></blockquote><p>Gain the Expedition Logbook reward card and <b>THE EXPEDITION'S PATH</b> mission. Discard Silaro Mako.</p>",
