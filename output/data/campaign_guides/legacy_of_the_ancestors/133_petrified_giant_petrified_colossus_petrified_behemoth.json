  "content": "<blockquote id=\"narration_1\"><p>This tree looms above its fellows in the grove. Unlike the trees on the outer edges, this is fully petrified, with the branches above the tree's crown having long since broken free. Or perhaps they were cut free, you wonder as you look closer, because the stumps seem smooth and regular. </p><p>You inspect the stone, and as you do, you see small grooves running up and down the trunks. It's as if something has climbed up and down the trunks so often it has worn channels into the rock surface. Perhaps if you can find that something, you can learn more about these trees and their purpose.</p></blockquote>",
