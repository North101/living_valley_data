But something about the quality of the sound feels off\u2014not like the soles of a boot on a cavern floor. You follow the sound and soon discover why.</p><p>A tall, broad-shouldered figure in exotic dress walks down the hall, staring up at the ceiling as he strides forward slowly and methodically. His face is obscured by a hat and tattered scarf, although two pinpricks of light peek out from within the darkness where his face should be. You can't be sure, but his body seems slightly translucent, and clouds of mist swirl about him.</p><p>If you had to guess, you\u2019d assume this is an Estian spirit. You wonder what he's looking for. </p></blockquote><p><i><span color=\"blue\">Clear this spirit with <span><icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon></span> to discern what he is looking for.</span></i></p>",
