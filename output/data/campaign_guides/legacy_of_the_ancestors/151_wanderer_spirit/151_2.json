  "content": "<blockquote id=\"narration_1\"><p>When you first began your journey with the wanderer, he was hesitant to follow, but as the hours passed and you spent more time in each other's company, he began to speak to you like a friend, pointing out places of interest, and seemingly telling you stories of his life and the people he knew, until eventually you began to understand him, after a fashion.</p><p>You get the sense that this spirit was someone who shouldered a great burden of responsibility in life. Perhaps he was something like an Elder or even a Ranger. Whatever his former role, he clearly cared deeply for the people who lived here, and still holds a great deal of grief for their loss.</p><p>As you reach the threshold of the next chamber, the spirit stops, and seems to look at something in the far distance. He turns, and places his hands on your shoulders. He levels the pinpricks of light that are his eyes with yours and speaks softly. While you don't understand the words, they still have an effect, and you feel a pleasant warmth grow in your chest.</p><p>The spirit then walks forward into the chamber, and as he goes, his figure is infused with golden light, and then, in a heartbeat, he is gone.</p></blockquote><p>Discard the Wanderer Spirit and permanently remove it from the Arcology set.
