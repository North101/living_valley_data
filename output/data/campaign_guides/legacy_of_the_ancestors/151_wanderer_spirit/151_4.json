At a turn in the passage, the spirit pauses, and finally acknowledges your presence.</p><p>He speaks to you in a startlingly deep voice, gesturing with his hands as he does. The language is that of the ancients, and while you are unable to understand it, you can still make out many familiar sounds. That, however, is where the similarites to your language end.</p><p>Despite this, you get the strong sense from his tone that he desires to be free. Perhaps he has been doomed to walk the same path for centuries, revisiting a past he would just as soon forget. If you can help this spirit break free from his familiar patterns, he might be able to move on. </p></blockquote><choice id=\"rangers-choose\">RANGERS CHOOSE</choice><p><b color=\"red\">A) Lead the Spirit on an unexpected journey.</b> Discard all <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> from the Wanderer Spirit and attach the Helping Hand mission to him.
