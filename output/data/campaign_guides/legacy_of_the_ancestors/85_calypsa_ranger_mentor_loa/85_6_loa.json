Not what I would have expected when I started hunting them, to be honest. Given how quickly they spawned two months ago, I was worried this would be a fool's errand. But now I can go several days without receiving reports of any or uncovering any new tracks.\" </p><p>She shrugs. \"Perhaps this is their life cycle, like a locust swarm: over as quickly as it comes. But in any case, I have been on the trail of one for most of today. I think I'm getting closer, but I could use some help with the tracking; the trail is starting to get fainter. Care to lend a hand?\"</p></blockquote><p><b color=\"red\">A) Help Calypsa look for the reclaimer.</b> Discard all <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> from Calypsa and attach <mission>HELPING HAND</mission>.
