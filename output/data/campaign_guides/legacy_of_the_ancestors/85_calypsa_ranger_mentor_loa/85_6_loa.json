Not what I would have expected when I started hunting them, to be honest. Given how quickly they spawned two months ago, I was worried this would be a fool\u2019s errand. But now I can go several days without receiving reports of any or uncovering any new tracks.\u201d </p><p>She shrugs. \u201cPerhaps this is their life cycle, like a locust swarm: over as quickly as it comes. But in any case, I have been on the trail of one for most of today. I think I\u2019m getting closer, but I could use some help with the tracking; the trail is starting to get fainter.
