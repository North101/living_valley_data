For a moment, you see the vines that fill the Verdant Sphere growing, reaching, wrapping around the arcology. </p><p>You gasp in panic and the vision vanishes, leaving you to stumble down onto one knee. You shake your head to clear the ringing. This must be some means of communication for a being without without a means to vocalize. But how to interpret it?   </p></blockquote><p><i><span class=\"text text_blue\">Clear the Familiar Verdessian with <span><icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon></span> to attempt to communicate with it.</span></i></p>",
