Although wary, you get a sense of recognition from it, or perhaps the patterns on its \"face\" look vaguely familiar. But that doesn't make sense \u2026 the last Verdessian that you encountered was killed. Or at least, that's what you thought. Your mind is filled with questions about the Verdessian's true nature.</p><p>As you and the Verdessian stare at each other, the patterns on its face shift and change, and suddenly your vision \u2026 flickers. For a moment, you see the vines that fill the Verdant Sphere growing, reaching, wrapping around the arcology. You feel a sudden panic mixed with awe that feels like it's coming from the Verdessian, not yourself.</p><p>You gasp and the vision vanishes, leaving you to stumble and go down onto one knee. You shake your head to clear the ringing. This must be some means of communication for a being without a means to vocalize. But how to interpret it?</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear the Familiar Verdessian with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to attempt to communicate with it.</i></p>",
