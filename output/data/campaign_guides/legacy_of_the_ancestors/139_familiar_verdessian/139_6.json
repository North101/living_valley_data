  "content": "<blockquote><p>The Verdessian turns to you and spreads its hands. Unsure of what this gesture might mean, you carefully and slowly do the same. </p><p>It remains motionless for a long moment, then suddenly, you catch a brief vision of thick, tangled roots. Are these the roots it wants you to destroy? You nod in agreement, then realizing the Verdessian might not understand your gestures, you try to focus your mind on the <i>concept</i> of agreement. </p><p>After another long moment, the Verdessian strides down the corridor; stopping every few meters, seemingly to make sure you're still following. And follow you do, through overgrown passageways until you see the tangle of roots from the vision as if you had imagined them into existence. </p><p>You turn to thank your inscrutible ally, but instead you find the passageway empty. </p></blockquote><p>Discard the Familiar Verdessian. Search the path deck for a Snarling Roots and put it into play.</p>",
