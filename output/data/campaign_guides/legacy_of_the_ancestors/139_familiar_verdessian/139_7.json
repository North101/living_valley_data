  "content": "<blockquote><p>You\u2019re not sure if a Verdessian\u2019s body language matches yours at all, but if it did, you\u2019d say the being seems frustrated. It slowly turns to face you, and your eyes are drawn to the patterns on its face. They seem to morph in strange patterns, and you feel almost like you're falling asleep. In that moment another vision fills your consciousness. </p><p>You see the massive rolling green of the Verdessa, stretching away to the south. The scene seems idyllic, but as you look closer, you see something writhing and twisting beneath the canopy, causing the treetops to rustle and buck in long, winding rows. Something is growing there, just out of sight. Something big, and destructive.</p><p>As the vision clears, you look around. Perhaps unsurprisingly, you find the passageway empty. The Verdessian has vanished. </p></blockquote><p>Discard the Familiar Verdessian.</p>",
