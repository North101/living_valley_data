As he does, you look out over the Valley. Something catches your eye: the Tenebrae, which normally roam implacably near the Ziggurats, are drifting with uncharacteristic haste toward the mountains to the west. You are about to say something to Silaro when he blows the last crisp note.</p><p>As soon as it rings out, it's met with a clap of thunder as a massive electrical discharge ignites several meters above your head and leaps from the Ziggurat upon which you're standing to the next one in sequence, then the next, then the next. For a long moment, the Ziggurats are wreathed in a crackling, blue-white light. Then, the energy seems to flow down the sides of the structures like a blazing flood, spreading out across the Valley floor before vanishing into the air.</p></blockquote><p>Record <event>POWERED UP THE ARCOLOGY</event> on the campaign tracker.
