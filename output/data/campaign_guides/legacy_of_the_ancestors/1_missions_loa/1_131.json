With a final burst of effort, you run as fast as your legs will carry you and leap through the hatch as the tunnel behind you collapses with a roar. </p><p>Slowly, you stagger to your feet. Rock dust fills the air. You peer back down the passageway from which you came, and sure enough, it's completely collapsed and filled with debris. There will be no returning to the lowest level of the arcology.</p><p>As you catch your breath, and the tremors subside, you grow increasingly confident that you're no longer in any immediate danger. You sit down heavily and breathe a sigh of relief, for soon you'll be back on the surface, and in this moment, you feel that day cannot come soon enough.</p></blockquote><p>Complete the <mission>ESCAPE!</mission> mission. The lower levels of the arcology have completely collapsed. Record <event>STRATUM 3 LOST</event> on the campaign tracker. You can no longer travel to the Stratum 3 map.
