  "content": "<blockquote id=\"narration_1\"><p>The hair on your arms stands on end as you approach the Ziggurats once more. It seems Silaro is still attempting to send power from the Ziggurats to the arcology below. A growing feeling of disquiet stirs around you, as if permeating the air. You climb one of the central structures, and Silaro greets you at the top.</p><p>\"Ah, you're here! Fantastic. We have a lot of work to do.\" He gestures to several of the other nearby Ziggurats. \"If we can redirect the energy emitted by these 'power nodes' into the arcology, who knows what we may discover? Do you remember the process I showed you?\" He nods before you even get the chance to respond. \"Good, good. You know what to do!\"</p></blockquote><p>Search the General set for 2 Unstable Ziggurats and shuffle them into the path deck.</p>",
