Then, after what seems like an eternity, it begins to beat once more. </p><p>The beats come faster now, strong and steady, with no arrhythmic fluctuations. The arcology ceases shaking, and you feel the tension drain from the room. In fact, you feel the best you've felt since this expedition began.</p><p>You wonder for a moment at what this could mean for the people of the Valley. How will the arcology behave now that it's fully awake and alive? What will that mean to the villages built upon the arcology itself?</p><p>As you begin to grapple with these questions, you remember your Ranger training. It's best not to dedicate too much thought to speculating about the future. All will be revealed in time.</p><p>To the sound of a steadily beating heart, you gather up your gear and prepare to return to the surface.</p></blockquote><p>Complete all Story and Interlude missions.
