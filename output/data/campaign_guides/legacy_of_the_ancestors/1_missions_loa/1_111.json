Harlan dampens a rag with his canteen and begins to wipe the tears and grime from his daughter\u2019s cheeks. Kal unlaces his boots and pours a surprising number of jagged rocks from them onto the floor. No one speaks.</p><p>Every few minutes you feel another quake, but with each subsequent tremor, the intensity seems to decrease. Eventually, there is only a deep rumbling sound, coming from somewhere far below.</p><p>You hear the sound of approaching footsteps, and then the space is suddenly filled with light. Silaro Mako stands at the threshold, his brightly glowing lambance rig held aloft.</p><p>\u201cI thought we might need some light\u2014\u201d he starts, then looks and sees you, Quisi, Harlan, and Kal disheveled, covered in dust, battered, but alive. \u201cOh, thank the ancestors!\u201d he says breathlessly. \u201cYou\u2019re all safe! Oh, thank goodness!\u201d </p><p>Silaro slumps against the wall in relief, and for once, his boundless enthusiasm seems to have left him. \u201cWhen we felt the first quake, I just knew \u2026 I knew that I had put you all in harm\u2019s way. \u2018Silaro,\u2019 I said. \u2018Silaro, if your foolish meddling has gotten your friends hurt \u2026 or worse \u2026\u2019 I don\u2019t know what I would have done.\u201d Silaro wipes the tears from his eyes and turns away. </p></blockquote><p>Complete the <b>BURIED SURVEY TEAM</b> mission.

You instinctively place your hands on the ground or against a wall, trying to maintain your balance. Silaro stumbles, drops his lambance rig, and falls to the floor. Above you, the countless tons of rock and earth groan and creak \u2026 but hold. </p><p>Without missing a beat, Silaro rolls into a sitting position and places his hands against the wall, feeling the vibration in the rock. When it stops, he opens his notebook and hastily scribbles something on the page. He speaks to himself under his breath, then looks at up at you, his eyes wide. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as I feared,\u201d he says. \u201cWhatever I did woke up the arcology alright, but not in the way I expected. I thought that maybe the lights would turn on, all the doors would open, or the 'preserved day' mechanisms would stabilize, but instead I think the whole system is trying to reactivate\u2014machinery that\u2019s been dormant for centuries\u2014perhaps attempting to execute some final directive instilled in it by the last of the Estians. There\u2019s no telling what will happen with all systems switched on and no one there to guide them. It could be collapsing on itself! What if the arcology systems somehow caused the Estians\u2019 extinction? The people of the Valley could be next!\u201d</p><p>You put a hand on SIlaro\u2019s shoulder and remind him that there is no need to panic. You\u2019ll get to the bottom of this and set things right.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m being foolish. I honestly have no idea what\u2019s happening or what will happen in the days to come. All I know is that this is all my fault. I\u2019ve put the entire Valley in jeopardy with my shortsighted behavior.\u201d </p><p>Silaro\u2019s voice is grave and firm. \u201cWhatever I hoped to learn down here doesn\u2019t matter anymore. We need to find whatever it is that's causing these quakes\u2014perhaps a malfunctioning engine of some kind\u2014and shut it down.\u201d He looks at you, his eyes grim. \u201cI must ask for your aid once again, my friend. Please, help me correct this grievous error.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Gain <b>THE LONG DARK</b> and <b>RATTLING THE CAGE</b> missions.</p><p>If you <span color=\"blue\">FELT A SUDDEN QUAKE</span>, continue reading:</p><blockquote><p>You tell Silaro that you'd be happy to help, but that you need to know more about what happened first.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\" he says. \"It was at the Concordant Ziggurats where it all went wrong. You see, I had found references to the Ziggurats in the Estian engravings down here. I've always theorized that the Ziggurats were once a power source for the arcology. Then I found another translation that spoke of an \u2018activation sequence.\u2019 This was my chance to put my theory to the test!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assumed that if I could activate the Ziggurats, they may give the systems down here in the arcology a boost. Perhaps they would cause some new passages to open, or power up a few ancient machines that we could investigate. Only I severely ... ah ... miscalculated. I had no idea how much power the Ziggurats would generate, nor how that power would affect the arcology.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat's more, not only do we now have these earthquakes, but when the Ziggurats discharged their power, they also blanketed the entire Valley in electric fog!\u201d</p><p>Silaro bows his head, clearly mortified.</p></blockquote>",
