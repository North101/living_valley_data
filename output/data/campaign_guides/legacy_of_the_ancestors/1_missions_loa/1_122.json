You're surpised to find that it appears to be fully functional, and unlike its counterpart, it beats at a steady rhythm.</p><p>After several hours of study, the evidence seems incontrovertible. Calling this a \"heart\" is too simplistic; the being the Estians created is that and so much more. </p><p>The way the nerves link to wires and machine interfaces, plus the pseudo-biological liquids pumped through the valves and aortas, leaves no doubt. The Estians designed the entire arcology as a single living organism, and this device was grown to be its literal heart, but also its mind. You shake your head as you grapple with the immense skill and towering ambition of the Estians. To create such a thing -- to give it life, and then live within it -- no idea could sound less appealing to any who live under the open sky.</p><p>Nevertheless, the actual heart in the center of the arcology is clearly not operating as it should. It's clear from what you've observed of the prototype that it beats in response to electric pulses sent to it from the regulator. You wonder if perhaps delivering an electric shock to the heart might cause the system to reset, and return its rhythm to normal.</p><p>You consider working only with what you have at hand, and think back on all that you've discovered on your journey through the arcology. You begin to put together a mental list of components, starting with a capacative leech \u2026 </p></blockquote><p>Complete the <mission>OVERGROWN</mission> mission and gain the <mission>JURY RIGGED</mission> mission.</p>",
