  "content": "<blockquote><p>After plenty of searching and pushing your way through feathery mycelial fronds and ducking under jutting giant shelf fungi, you finally find a properly dense clump of mushrooms. Clearing a spot in front of the towering stalks, you kneel down, close your eyes, and attempt to listen to the murmuring voices.</p><p>Almost at once, you notice the voices of the mycelial network seem louder and clearer. You extend a word of cautious greeting, and are thrilled when you hear an echoing greeting return! The voices are muddled and many are speaking a language you don\u2019t understand, but you can sense some of the personalities behind them. Some of the words resemble the bits of the Estian tongue that Silaro shared with you, and you start to suspect that this network was used to preserve the thoughts of the Estians. You\u2019re not sure if this was done on purpose, or if the fungal network grew into the bodies of some unfortunate Estians and absorbed their intellect. Then you hear a voice that speaks in your own tongue. \u201cHello?\u201d it says. \u201cAre you there? Who are you?\u201d </p><p>You try and respond, but the voice immediately fades, only to come again from farther away. You call out, and it moves again. It\u2019s almost like the voice is leaping from mushroom to mushroom like an echo bouncing through a cave. Unless you can isolate the sound, you don\u2019t think you'll be able to effectively communicate with it. </p></blockquote><p>Flip <b>MYCELIAL NETWORKING</b> over to its <b>GHOST IN THE MYCELIA</b> side, but don\u2019t change your mission log. If you don\u2019t track down the voice today, you will need to find a large group of mushrooms again.</p><p>Place a voice token onto a flora. <span color=\"blue\">This is the voice you have heard. Clear the flora holding the voice token to attempt to speak with it.</span></p>",
