You find that if you remain still, and listen beyond the sound of dripping water\u2014and that of your own heartbeat\u2014you can perceive a distant thrum coming from somewhere above, reverberating through the surrounding rock. The rhythm of the thrum syncs with the occasional release of water into the chamber from the openings above, followed shortly thereafter by a low gurgling sound as that water is flushed from the chamber. You reflect on how great is the generosity of the Estians that they should leave so many mechanical wonders to be discovered and utilized by a people they would never meet in waking life.</p></blockquote><p>Discard all surveys from the <b>SURVEY THE DEPTHS</b> mission card.

You\u2019re surprised then to learn that the Carbon Forge he discovered was but one of many\u2014part of a vast workshop in which much of what the Estians wrought was brought to life and subsequently abandoned. However, these other forges are clearly in a state of horrible disrepair, perhaps beyond salvaging. You also find several depowered and disassembled machines, some as small as your closed fist, but others the size of a stilt horse. You\u2019re guessing the Estians used these machines extensively in constructing and maintaining the arcology, and there are probably more workshops and maintenance bays deeper within.</p></blockquote><p>Discard all surveys from the <b>SURVEY THE DEPTHS</b> mission card.

Honeycombed mounds of earth and towers of gathered clay now sit upon the ruin of the Estians\u2019 great achievement. If the Estians were also responsible for the creation of the spindlescuttlers, as is commonly believed, then perhaps it is fitting that the spindlescuttlers should be the ones to continue the Estians' work, building more structures upon the foundation laid by their creators, thriving in their absence.</p></blockquote><p>Discard all surveys from the <b>SURVEY THE DEPTHS</b> mission card.

In this moment, you become fully aware of the inherent stillness of the arcology, and you wonder: if you weren\u2019t down here tromping around, how much quieter it would be. Would it be wiser, perhaps, to leave this place undisturbed? Your thoughts drift to memories of the open sky and to the sweet scent of sunberries on the breeze.</p><p>You\u2019re stirred from your reverie by the sound of approaching footsteps and hushed conversation. To your surprise, Quisi Vos comes sprinting toward you, her way illuminated by a curious lantern\u2014a transparent sphere containing what appears to be a glowing slug. You spot her father, Harlan, and Kal Iver walking calmly behind. Quisi sits down heavily beside you. \u201cThis place is INCREDIBLE!\u201d she says. \u201cLook at this slug I found!\u201d Quisi is in the middle of recounting the Finding of the Slug when her father and Kal approach.</p><p>\u201cSorry to interrupt your story, Quisi,\u201d Harlan says. \u201cBut we have a message from Silaro for our friend here.\u201d He turns to you. \u201cSilaro\u2019s research has borne fruit, and he\u2019s off to the Concordant Ziggurats to put it to the test. He\u2019s requested your help in whatever he plans to do there, so he sent us on an errand to find you and deliver the message. Before we left, he was going on about the arcology being \u2018asleep\u2019 and just needing a nudge to wake up. I\u2019ve never seen him so excited\u2014and that\u2019s saying something.\u201d</p><p>Kal steps forward. \u201cI\u2019ll take over the survey mission from here, so you can go help Silaro,\u201d he says. \u201cSilaro had a wild gleam in his eye when we left him. I\u2019m not sure what to make of it. I think he may be more in need of your good sense than anything else you might provide.\u201d You brief Kal on your survey progress and make note of the final location on your list.</p><p>Kal claps you on the shoulder. \u201cLeave it to me,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cAnd me!\u201d Quisi announces. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Kal! Whoever\u2019s got the slug goes first!\u201d With that, Quisi is off, her father close behind. Kal looks at you pleadingly for a moment, then follows. </p></blockquote><p>Complete the <b>SURVEY THE DEPTHS</b> mission and gain the <b>AN URGENT REQUEST</b> mission.
