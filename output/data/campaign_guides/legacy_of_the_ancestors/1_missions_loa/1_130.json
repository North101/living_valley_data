  "content": "<blockquote><p>You\u2019re running up the sloping tunnel when the rock groans around you. You jump into an alcove just off of the passageway, covering your head as the top of the tunnel begins to split apart with a dreadful grinding sound. </p><p>Suddenly, with an awful roar, the ceiling gives way! Tons of fractured stone pours into the passageway you just vacated, enveloping you in an thick cloud of choking dust. You wait several heartbeats for the air to clear, wrapping your cloak around your face, taking shallow breaths to avoid filling your lungs with grit. Eventually, the dust settles, and you're able to take a look around. </p><p>Sure enough, the passageway is filled with debris. You shine a light on your surroundings, but there is no other way in or out. You're trapped.</p><p>As you sit confined to your tomb, you lose all sense of time. You do your best to ration your food and water. Days seem to pass. Your supplies are growing uncomfortably low. Suddenly you think you hear a scraping sound coming from the other side of the cave-in. You shout and hear muffled voices in reply. </p><p>An eternity later, you can hardly believe it when a large rock falls away to reveal the faces of Kal and Calypsa on the other side. Along with several other Rangers, they pull you free and guide you toward the surface. </p></blockquote><p>Each Ranger adds 2 Lingering Injuries to their deck. Complete the <b>ESCAPE!</b> mission. The lower levels of the arcology have completely collapsed. Record <span color=\"blue\">STRATUM 3 LOST</span> on the campaign tracker. You can no longer travel to the Stratum 3 map. Gain <b>THE FINAL ASCENT</b> mission.</p><p>Mark your current location as the Branching Artery and your terrain as Ancient Ruins on your campaign tracker.</p>",
