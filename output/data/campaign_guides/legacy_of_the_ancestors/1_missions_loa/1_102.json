There's just so much to discover down here! I could spend my entire life in these halls!\" </p><p>You politely but persistently suggest that Silaro would be better off at the base camp organizing the operation, and that he can send others to scout in his stead. He keeps brushing off your suggestions until he stands up \u2026 and almost falls over on his face.</p><p>\"Oh,\" he says when you help steady him. \"I guess I have missed a few too many meals. Very well. You win, you win. Let's return to base camp.

You poke your head in and see a vertical shaft about four meters deep. At the bottom is Silaro. His wan features break into a huge grin when he sees you. You quickly rig up ropes and haul the wayward archaeologist out of the hole. He is battered, pale, and has a pronounced limp, but he's alive. </p><p>\"Thank the ancestors!\" he says as he hungrily devours the trail mix you provide him. \"I was going along just fine, following my topographone, as I do. I turned a corner, and boof! A pit! I've been stuck there ever since. It's rather embarrassing, frankly. </p><p>\"Perhaps I'd better get up to camp and see how they're getting on,\" he says. \"I would appreciate your further assistance, of course. I wouldn't want to accidentally fall into any more pits!\"</p></blockquote><p>Complete the <mission>SEARCH BELOW (SILARO)</mission> mission and gain the <mission>RETURN TO BASE CAMP (SILARO)</mission> mission.
