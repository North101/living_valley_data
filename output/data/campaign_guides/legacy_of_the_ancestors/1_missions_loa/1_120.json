The sky has cleared during your journey, and where once was a tempest, now stars burn in the firmament with an almost painful intensity, each a different color that, somehow, you know is entirely unique. </p><p>Nal is there, and she gestures for everyone to join her in a circle. You and the spirits take a seat, and it is not long before they begin to speak once again. This time, however, their ancient dialect seems to blend and harmonize. Nal begins to hum, low and resonant, and somehow the hum clarifies their voices as words take shape. After a moment, you realize you can now understand exactly what they are saying. </p><p>\u201cThey wish to know about heart,\u201d the Wanderer says to the Archivist. </p><p>You say that you do indeed, and ask them why there is a living heart at the center of the arcology. </p><p>At this, the three spirits laugh. \u201cThe heart is alive because the body it inhabits is alive,\u201d says the Gardener. \u201cHow could it be otherwise?\u201d</p><p>You ask her what body she's referring to. </p><p>\u201cWhy, Vista, of course,\" says the Archivist. \"That which you call \u2018the arcology.\u2019 Know that many arcologies were built long ago, but Vista was the greatest of them all. Vista is the body, and the heart pumps its blood.\u201d </p><p>Nonplussed by their response, you ask the spirits if they can tell you why the heart is malfunctioning. </p><p>\u201cWe all absorb the traumas that befall us,\u201d says the Wanderer. \u201cVista, the heart, they are no different. The flood was a trauma to us all, and while most of us were fortunate enough to perish when it came, the heart lived on. Left alone to grapple with the death, the destruction, and the loss; then, being left alone in a darkened chamber for centuries. Its beating slowed as it slept to hide from its grief. Then power surged through it once more. In a moment it was jolted awake, and in that moment, it recalled a thousand years of grief, anger, and despair. It was too much for it to bear. It wishes only to forget. To sleep.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSoothe the heart.\u201d the Gardener says. \u201cHeal its trauma. Only by bringing it peace will the people of the Valley be safe.\u201d</p><p>Nal\u2019s song fades, as so do the spirits. The tableau of Greenbriar Knoll begins to unravel as your physical surroundings nibble at the edges of the horizon. But even as the voices fade, you hear the Archivist, as if he was speaking directly into your mind. </p><p>\u201cBe warned!\u201d he says. \u201cJust as your mind and body are linked, so it is with the heart. If you wish the heart to live on, you must heal its physical ailments in addition to its emotional ones. You must be workers of flesh as well as the spirit.\u201d </p><p>His voice fades to a whisper, and your eyes open in the waking world.</p></blockquote><p>Complete the <b>CONTACT NAL</b> mission and return <b>SPIRIT COUNCIL</b> to the collection.
