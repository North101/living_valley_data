Then you see the patch of mushrooms she is tending. In this dreaming place, the Gardener is whole once more, and looks no more or less living than you do. </p><p>With her knowledge of the mycelial network that exists within the arcology, the Gardener knows not only a great deal about biology, but also about the link between biology and emotion. You ask her to follow you, and the Gardener straightens and falls into step behind you, still cradling a tiny fungal cap that glows a crackling pink. </p><p><b>Wanderer Spirit:</b> The way this faceless spirit strides purposefully forward before briefly pausing to study his surroundings is unmistakable to you. You recognize him as the Wanderer, the spirit who roams the halls of the arcology ceaselessly. In this dreaming place, he looks like he could be just as alive as you, though his face remains hidden. </p><p>You feel that the Wanderer, of all the spirits, has the greatest understanding of the arcology. If part, or all, of the place is alive, he will understand it as few others can. You ask him to follow, and he bows as if to say, \"Of course.\"</p><p><b>Archivist Spirit:</b> Before you stands a solitary tree from the Arboretum of Memory, its branches swaying in an inperceptible breeze. At its base, you find the archivist in the middle of some task as he places his hand upon it and records something on his scroll. The spirit and the tree glow with a pale white light. He regards you for a moment, then returns to his work. </p><p>If anyone would know precisely what happened to the arcology and its heart, it would be the Archivist. You ask him to follow, and after jotting a few more notes, he tucks his scroll away and walks forward. </p></blockquote><p><b>Then, if all three of these spirits are in play, continue reading:</b></p><blockquote><p>The spirits begin to speak to each other, but you cannot understand them, for they speak in what must have been their ancient tongue. As they talk, however, you soon get the sense that you need only walk with them awhile, and they will share their knowledge with you soon enough.</p></blockquote><p><i color=\"blue\">Travel away from Greenbriar Knoll to complete their communion and get the answers you seek.</i></p><h1 id=\"1119b\">1.119B</h1><blockquote><p>Your mind drifts as mundane thoughts intrude upon the journey, but whenever the vision begins to fade, Nal is there to help you focus on the task at hand. You wonder, are you sharing Nal's vision? Or is she sharing yours? Or is all this in your mind, nothing more than a product of your imagination?</p><p>\"It matters not,\" Nal replies, though you did not speak your questions aloud. \"Such is the nature of being. Awake or dreaming, all is real. All is relevant. The Shapers understand this, and use tools which nullify the distinction. In this place, we need no tools, for we have our highest selves to guide us.\"</p><p>She gestures toward the path, and you see with the eyes of a sparrowhawk as the way forward comes into glorious focus.</p></blockquote><p>You may move each being. Then discard all <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> from Nal. She remains in play.</p><h1 id=\"1119c\">1.119C</h1><blockquote><p>As you continue on your journey, you ask your new traveling companion what they can tell you about the arcology and its heart. The spirit listens to you patiently, then gives you a lengthy response in Estian that you can\u2019t make any sense of.</p><p>While you don't understand their words, the sentiment is clear. They will share what they know once all are gathered, and not a moment before.</p></blockquote><p>Discard all <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> from them. They remain in play.</p><h1 id=\"1119d\">1.119D</h1><blockquote><p>Nal's expression darkens. \"There is some other power at work here -- an unfriendly force that does not wish us to complete our task,\" she says. \"I will keep it at bay as best I can. Try your best to visualize a clear path; one free of danger, and free from worry.\"</p></blockquote><p>Each Ranger suffers 3 fatigue. Then discard all <span color=\"red\"><icon icon=\"harm\">&nbsp;</icon></span> from Nal. She remains in play.</p>",
