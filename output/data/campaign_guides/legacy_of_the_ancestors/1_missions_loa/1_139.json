Taking a moment to catch your breath and study your surroundings, you see that the several large roots twist around each other, growing in nearby chambers and beyond. From each root, inumerable vines grow, too abundant and tenacious to do anything about.</p></blockquote><p>If <b>RECLAIMERS\u2019 FATE</b> is in play, flip it back to its <b>AT THE SOURCE</b> side.

Something seems familiar to you about its shape. Then it shivers and moves, and you slowly you see the Verdessian assume its shape before your very eyes. It steps forward. </p><p>You\u2019re not sure if a Verdessian\u2019s body language matches yours at all, but if it did you\u2019d say the being seems frustrated. It \"stares\" for a long time at the endlessly twisting roots. After a time, it slowly turns to face you, and your eyes are drawn to the patterns on its face. They seem to morph in strange patterns, and you feel almost like you're falling asleep. In that moment another vision fills your consciousness. </p><p>You see the massive rolling green of the Verdessa, stretching away to the south. The scene seems idyllic, but as you look closer, you see something writhing and twisting beneath the canopy, causing the treetops to rustle and buck in long, winding rows. Something is growing there, just out of sight. Something big, and destructive.</p><p>A feeling of foreboding looms over you, and you know that the feeling is coming from the Verdessian, not you. While you're still unsure as to what it was hoping to achieve down here, or what it's relationship was to these vines, it's clear that it has bigger problems on the horizon.</p><p>As the vision clears, you look around. Perhaps unsurprisingly, you find the passageway empty. The Verdessian has vanished.</p></blockquote><p>Gain the Grasp of the Verdessa reward card.
