Destroyed? All that history, all those records, buried forever.\u201d </p><p>Kordo shakes his head, and claps you on your shoulder. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he says bluntly. \u201cThe important thing is, you\u2019re safe. Your lives, and the lives of all our expedition members, matter far more than any dusty old tome.\u201d</p><p>Silaro slowly nods. \u201cYou\u2019re right, of course.\u201d But you can see the gleam of unspilled tears in his eyes. </p><p color=\"blue\">SAVED THE HEART:</p><p>\u201cBy the ancestors, you did it!\u201d says Silaro, grinning from ear to ear. \u201cAfter my foolish mistake with the Ziggurats, I thought I had doomed us all! But not only did you save the Valley, you preserved its heart as well! Amazing!\u201d </p><p>\u201cMore than simply amazing.\u201d You didn\u2019t see Ben Amon arrive, but there he is, arms crossed and a smile on his face. \u201cWe\u2019ve already started to notice changes on the surface. It appears as though some of the ruins are repairing themselves! There's no telling how our lives will be affected by this development, or what it will mean for future generations. A living, intelligent structure! It boggles the mind.\u201d </p><p>Elder Thrush puts a hand on Ben Amon's shoulder. \u201cOnly time will tell,\" she says. \"In the meantime, we will continue to safeguard the Valley, and all that lives within it.\u201d</p><p>She turns now to you. \u201cYou should be proud! You've lived up to the highest standards of our order, protecting all life, even one as strange as the ancient marvel you've discovered. We all owe you a debt of gratitude. The people of the Valley will not soon forget what you've accomplished. Well done!\u201d</p><p color=\"blue\">SILENCED THE HEART:</p><p>Silaro\u2019s face looks pained as you finish your story. He takes a deep breath and speaks, his voice quavering. </p><p>\u201cHow tragic! I knew my error with the Ziggurats had put us in a dire situation. That you were able to discover the heart, and even tried to help it \u2026 well, that\u2019s far more than anyone could expect.\u201d Elder Thrush nods in agreement. \u201cIndeed. You lived up to the highest standards of our order, protecting all life in the Valley to the best of your ability. Even the heart, however strange was the life that it lived.\u201d </p><p>You all stand silently for a moment. Then Silaro speaks up. \u201cIt might be cold comfort,\u201d he says. \u201cBut thanks to your efforts, the structural integrity of the arcology has been largely preserved. One can only imagine what we might learn from continued study of this place.\u201d</p><p>You look at Silaro incredulously. He doesn't seem to notice. </p><p color=\"blue\">KILLED THE HEART:</p><p>Silaro\u2019s face looks pained as you finish your story. \u201cI knew my error with the Ziggurats had put us in a dire situation,\" he says. \"You did all you could, I'm sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds to me like the heart was yet another creation of the ancestors run amok,\u201d says Kordo. He holds his darter close, and his eyes drift to the darkened corners of the chamber. \u201cA tragic tale to be sure, but if not for your actions we would be having this conversation at the bottom of a sinkhole.\u201d</p><p>As you told your tale, Elder Thrush remained silent. She speaks now in a somber tone. \u201cI have no doubt that your actions prevented disaster,\" she says. \"As Rangers we bear the responsibility of protecting all life in the Valley, even though we are not always able to do so. The loss of the heart \u2014 its life in exchange for ours \u2014 is a grievous one. We must do all that we can to prove ourselves worthy of its sacrifice.\u201d </p><p color=\"blue\">CONSULTED THE SPIRITS:</p><p>Nal steps through the gathered crowd, and meets you with a warm embrace. </p><p>\u201cIt's good to see you,\" she says. \"After our experience with the spirits of the Estians, I decided that I had to see the arcology for myself. Now that I'm here, however, I think I'm ready to go home.\" Nal looks wistfully toward the spiral stairway. \"Even after communing with the spirits of the Estians, it's difficult for me to imagine why so many of them chose to live underground. They truly were a unique and fascinating people.\" She laughs. \"I wonder if in two thousand years our descendents will say the same about us. Somehow, I don't doubt it.\"</p><p color=\"blue\">SAVED THE TEAM:</p><p>\"Hiiiiii!\" A familiar, high-pitched voice rises above the din. Quisi Vos runs toward you at full speed and leaps into a hug. Somehow, you manage not to spill your drink.</p><p>Not far behind are her parents, Harlan and Oura, walking arm in arm.</p><p>\"Quisi and Harlan told me all about what happened during the first earthquake,\" Oura says. She takes your hand in hers. \"Thank you for saving them.\"</p><p>You smile, and say you're welcome. It's all in a day's work.</p><p color=\"blue\">BESTED KAL:</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Kal steps forward, punching you good-naturedly in the arm. \u201cGlad to see you made it in one piece!\u201d </p><p>He smiles. \u201cI knew you were the right choice for this mission. As you well know, I've never once doubted your abilities!\u201d </p><p>You dramatically raise an eyebrow, and you and Kal both burst into laughter.</p><p>He passes you a canteen that, from the smell, is full of Kordo's best cherrymoss brandy. You both take a swig, toasting each other and basking in the glow of friendship forged through adversity.</p><p color=\"blue\">VISIONS OF THE VERDESSA:</p><p>You raise your arms, and the hubbub dies down. You explain that there\u2019s one more part to the story, and tell the assembly about the return of the Verdessian. After you explain the visions it shared with you and the strange and unsettling problems brewing deep in the jungle, you see nervous faces and begin to hear worried mutters. </p><p>\u201cI thought that the Verdessian\u2019s behavior during the reclaimer invasion seemed a bit odd,\" says Sirisana Mir. \"Your story makes some sense of it at least. Perhaps we should investigate. For my part, I wouldn't say no to an opportunity to explore the Verdessa.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Kordo grunts. \u201cWe may need to go take a look for ourselves.\u201d </p><p>Voices rise at this comment, and there is suddenly a lot of excited chatter. Then Elder Thrush raises her arms for quiet. \u201cNo one is going to the Verdessa,\" she says. \"Not yet at least. We will discuss this further at the next council of elders. For now, I see no cause for concern.\u201d </p></blockquote><p><b>\u00bb Continue reading:</b></p><blockquote><p>Conversation continues throughout the night, and as the hours pass, and dawn approaches, you feel yourself drawn more and more to the surface. After so many days underground, you're feeling ready to walk again under the open sky.</p><p>You excuse yourself, and ascend the spiral stairway. Time seems to slow to a crawl, but soon enough you reach the final steps, and then find yourself beneath the towering spike of gleaming carbon for which the village of Spire was named.</p><p>The sun is just rising above the mountains, warm winds and clear skies heralding the summer day to come. You close your eyes and feel the sunlight on your skin. You breathe deep and savor the sweetness of the air. Birdsong mingles with the burbling sound of the river, and as you open your eyes you behold the Valley in all its glory, painted in vibrant colors by the early morning sun.</p><p>Welcome home.</p></blockquote><p>The story of the Estian arcology is now complete.
