You\u2019ve found no shortage of the curious \"quantum cubes\" he told you about, but only a precious few still carry a charge.</p><p>Cautiously, you hold one of the glass cubes over the square recess on the underside of the underwater-breathing device, then plug it into place. </p><p>The light at the center of the cube pulses. Then golden lines, moving like poured honey, travel along the surface of the collar until it is covered with a fine, luminous tracery. The glow eventually subsides, leaving behind Estian script painted in burnished gold. </p><p>You place the collar over your head, and when it makes contact with your shoulders, it projects a shimmering bubble around the mantle, just wide enough to surround your head. Now that the device is functional, all that remains is to put it to the test.</p></blockquote><p>Complete the <b>BREATHE EASIER</b> mission. Write <span color=\"blue\">ACQUIRED A REBREATHER</span> on the campaign tracker. Gain the Rebreather reward.</p><p>Each Ranger may suffer 2 fatigue to swap a card in their hand for one copy of the Rebreather reward (this counts as swapping in a reward card as described on page 31 of the rulebook).</p><p><i><p color=\"blue\">Now that you have a way to swim the Flooded Passage, you\u2019ll be able to reach new areas within the arcology.</p></i></p>",
