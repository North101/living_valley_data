A few moments later comes another jolt, and then another and another. Over the constant cracks and through the strobing flashes of arcing electricity, you hear the heart beating steadily. You did it! The heart's been stabilized.</p><p>You hastily remove the device. The heart\u2019s beat remains regular, but the beats seem to be growing weaker. Something is still very wrong. </p></blockquote><p>If you are on <b>THE CAGE CRUMBLES</b>, go to <a href=\"#1127a\">1.127a</a></p><p>If you have completed <b>CARDIAC THERAPY</b>, go to <a href=\"campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/1_missions_loa/1_128\">1.128</a>.</p><p>Otherwise, continue reading:</p><choice id=\"rangers-choose\">RANGERS CHOOSE</choice><p color=\"red\">A) Let the heart pass away.</p><blockquote id=\"narration_2\"><p>You've done all you can.
