  "content": "<blockquote><p>As you reach the top of a low hill, you see the first of the massive Ziggurats rising out of the forest. Sure enough, you can just make out a figure standing at the top. You head for the first of the meter-high \u201csteps\u201d and gird yourself for the arduous climb. </p><p>As you mount the final step, Silaro looks up from his equipment\u2014some sort of kinetic glass display. \u201cOh good! You made it. And just in time!\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve uncovered something remarkable.\u201d </p><p>He gestures around him. \u201cWe\u2019ve long suspected that the Ziggurats are some sort of power source; maybe they generate power, or perhaps they bring it from somewhere else. But in any case, in the writings I\u2019ve interpreted, the Estians refer to them as \u2018power nodes,\u2019 and together they provide energy to the arcology.</p><p>\u201cI believe now that the new passages we\u2019ve been exploring underground have been opened by the arcology itself! Some sort of autonomous reaction! And if that\u2019s true, I wonder what the arcology would do if we gave it a little more juice.\u201d</p><p>You ask why Silaro assumes the Ziggurats aren\u2019t sending their power to the arcology already, and he points to his kinetic glass display. \u201cLook at these readings! The Ziggurats are bleeding energy off into their surroundings. It explains why we always feel so edgy around them. But the writings also explain how we can shift them, get the power under control, and redirect it back into the arcology where it belongs.\u201d </p><p>Silaro begins to demonstrate the process\u2014using sympathetic resonance with a precise series of whistles\u2014and you look at the other Ziggurats marching away into the distance. Looks like there\u2019s some more climbing in your future.</p></blockquote><p>Complete the <b>AN URGENT REQUEST</b> mission and gain the <b>POWER UP</b> mission. Search the General set for 2 Unstable Ziggurats and shuffle them into the path deck.</p>",
