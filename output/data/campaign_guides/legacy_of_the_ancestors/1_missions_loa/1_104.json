  "content": "<blockquote><p>You spend hours at the swap meet, exchanging items and tales in equal measure. Although the new supplies are useful, learning what many of the people of the Valley have been up to since the reclaimer invasion is the most valuable part of the meet. </p><p>Eventually, the sun dips behind the mountains, and everyone begins to pack their bags and prepare to leave. You say your farewells and receive many well-wishes. Then, as long shadows stretch across the market lawn, you cinch up your cloak, sling your pack over your shoulder, and head out.</p></blockquote><p>Complete the <b>KOBO\u2019S SWAP MEET</b> mission. Return the Swappables deck and discard to the collection.</p>",
