As you strike the final blow, the biomeld crashes to the tunnel floor. Leaping clear, you land in a dramatic crouch.</p><p>As you inspect the once-majestic biomeld, you see a bolt of fabric hooked and twisted around one of its many \"teeth.\" Wincing, you reach in and pull the fabric free.</p><p>It's a cloak; torn but salvagable, and not of Estian make. With a sickening feeling you realize to whom, in all likelihood, this cloak once belonged. You're certain you've discovered the fate of at least one member of the lost expedition, and you give thanks to the ancestors that the same fate did not befall you.</p></blockquote><p>Complete the <mission>ONE THOUSAND LEGS (WILD SCUTTLEBUS)</mission> mission. Permanently remove the Wild Scuttlebus from the Artery set. Gain the <reward>\"Lucky\" Cloak</reward> reward card. Each Ranger soothes 2 fatigue.</p><p>If Kordo, Ranger Veteran is in play, continue reading:</p><blockquote id=\"narration_2\"><p>Kordo whistles. \"Well, I think you have outdone even my reputation as a hunter! Thank you for letting me tag along. Though now I need some well-earned rest back at Lone Tree. I'll see you when you resurface.\"</p></blockquote><p>Discard Kordo, Ranger Veteran.</p>",
