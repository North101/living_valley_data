Lunn would be impressed. You\u2019ve fulfilled your promise and repaired his custom-made door opener. You might even go so far as to say that you\u2019ve even improved on it a bit!</p></blockquote><p>Gain the Lunn's Door Opener reward. Each Ranger may search their deck or hand for a card to swap for one copy of the Lunn's Door Opener reward (this counts as swapping in a reward card as described on page 31 of the rulebook).</p><p color=\"red\">2-3 Errors</p><blockquote><p>When you accidentally melted one of the adapters, you were certain that you\u2019d need to head back into the depths to find more.

With a crackling sound, golden sparks leap from the connectors. Then, after a moment, it hums pleasantly. Lunn\u2019s door opener is fully functional once again. </p></blockquote><p>Gain the Lunn's Door Opener reward.

You check the flow of power into the device, and even though tiny arcs of energy leap from it in places, you\u2019re reasonably certain that it\u2019s not going to explode.
