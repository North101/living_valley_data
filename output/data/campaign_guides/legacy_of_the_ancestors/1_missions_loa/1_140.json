You had lived your entire life not knowing that they were there, just under your feet. Who knows then what revelations the dawn might bring? You, for one, have learned to open yourself to whatever may come, and to the endless possibilities inherent to your own existence.</p></blockquote><p>Complete <b>THE ARCOLOGY\u2019S SECRETS</b> mission, and gain the As Above, So Below reward card.</p><p>Your story will continue, but for now, you must rest.
