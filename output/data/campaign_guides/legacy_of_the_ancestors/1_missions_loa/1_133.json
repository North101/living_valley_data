You sit inside, and wait. </p><p>Soon, you hear a rumbling down the main tunnel, and the vibrating rustle of hundreds of legs tipped with chitinous spikes. Another moment, and the scuttlebus emerges from the gloom, barreling toward you. </p></blockquote><p>Flip the <b>ONE THOUSAND LEGS (WILD SCUTTLEBUS)</b> card over to the <b>BEFORE THE MANDIBLES</b> side, but don\u2019t change your mission log. If you don\u2019t complete the confrontation today, you will have to track it down again.</p><p>Put the Wild Scuttlebus into play within reach of a Ranger of your choice and attach <b>BEFORE THE MANDIBLES</b> to it. Do not read its entry.
