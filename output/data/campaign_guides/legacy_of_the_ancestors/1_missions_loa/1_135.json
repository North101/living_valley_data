You sit down and place your bare hands on the leathery skin that makes up the \"console\u201d and hold them there until the scuttlebus comes to a complete stop. When it does, several hatches open along its length, and from each extends a ramp.</p><p>You step off of the bus, and cautiously walk away before the hatches close, and it scuttles off into the darkness. It seems like the scuttlebus is back in service.</p></blockquote><p>Complete the <b>ONE THOUSAND LEGS (WILD SCUTTLEBUS)</b> mission. Permanently remove the Wild Scuttlebus from the Artery set. Gain the Call the Scuttlebus reward card.

And you know what, connecting with that thing was as hard as any hunt\u2014but don't tell her I said that. I'm going to head back to Lone Tree for some well-earned rest. I'll see you when you resurface.\"</p></blockquote><p>Discard Kordo, Ranger Veteran.</p>",
