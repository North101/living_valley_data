When she sees you, her face lights up, and she waves you over. You haven't seen her since she lent you the services of Gus, her trusty mole, whose sensitive nose led you to discover where the reclaimers were nesting.</p><p>As you approach, Tiella clears her throat and looks at you expectantly. \"I distinctly remember that you promised to return Gus once the reclaimer threat had passed,\" she says. \"It's been two whole cycles, and no Gus!\" </p><p>You apologize, and Tiella's expression softens. You unhook Gus's traveling cage from your pack and hand him over. \"Gus!\" she exclaims. \"I've missed you, little man!\" </p><p>Gus snuffles happily and she pulls him from the cage so the two can nuzzle one another affectionately. You look at your tiny and stalwart companion, happy to see him reunited with Tiella but sad to see him go. </p><p>As you turn to leave, the mole lets out a distressed chirp. Tiella regards him for a long moment.</p><p>\"I think Gus wants to stay with you,\" she says. \"Clearly he's acquired a taste for adventure.\" </p><p>You protest, but Tiella shushes you. She nuzzles Gus one last time, then sets him gently back into his cage. \"Be safe out there, little man,\" she whispers. \"And come back to see me soon.\" </p></blockquote><p>Gain the <reward>Gus the Mole</reward> reward card.
