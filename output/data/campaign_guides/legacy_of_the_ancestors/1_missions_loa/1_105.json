When she sees you, her face lights up, and she waves you over. You haven't seen her since she lent you the services of Gus, her trusty mole, whose sensitive nose led you to discover where the reclaimers were nesting.</p><p>As you approach, Tiella clears her throat and looks at you expectantly. \u201cI distinctly remember that you promised to return Gus once the reclaimer threat had passed,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been two whole cycles, and no Gus!\u201d </p><p>You apologize, and Tiella\u2019s expression softens. You unhook Gus's traveling cage from your pack and hand him over. \u201cGus!\u201d she exclaims. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you, little man!\u201d </p><p>Gus snuffles happily and she pulls him from the cage so the two can nuzzle one another affectionately. You look at your tiny and stalwart companion, happy to see him reunited with Tiella but sad to see him go. </p><p>As you turn to leave, the mole lets out a distressed chirp. Tiella regards him for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cI think Gus wants to stay with you,\u201d she says. \u201cClearly he\u2019s acquired a taste for adventure.\u201d </p><p>You protest, but Tiella shushes you. She nuzzles Gus one last time, then sets him gently back into his cage. \u201cBe safe out there, little man,\u201d she whispers. \u201cAnd come back to see me soon.\u201d </p></blockquote><p>Gain the Gus the Mole reward card.
