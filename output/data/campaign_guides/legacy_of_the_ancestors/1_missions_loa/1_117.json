  "content": "<blockquote id=\"narration_1\"><p>While exploring the arcology's depths, you've discovered many monuments to the Estians' greatness, but nothing could have prepared you for this.</p><p>When Silaro shared with you his theory of an engine, it evoked images of a hulking machine with a searing energetic glow at its center, or perhaps a device similar to the Waterspinner that powers Tumbledown. </p><p>But no. At the center of the space, guarded by a gigantic ribcage of gleaming metal and composite struts, you can see a massive beating heart; a heart, to all appearances, of flesh and blood.</p></blockquote><p>Complete <mission>THE LONG DARK</mission> mission.</p><blockquote id=\"narration_2\"><p>The heart's beat is arrhythmic and erratic. As it stutters, you watch the attendant machines in the chamber judder in response, and occasionally you hear a groaning and rumbling in the distance. </p><p>The heart's arrhythmia seems to be destabilizing the arcology's systems, and possibly the entire structure. There can be no doubt: this is the source of the earthquakes.</p><p>If you don't do something about the heart, you worry that the entire arcology could collapse upon itself, and as Silaro suggested, swallow up the entire Valley in the process.</p></blockquote><p color=\"red\">A) Destroy the heart immediately.</p><blockquote id=\"narration_3\"><p>Clearly, the simplest solution is to destroy the heart. It's sad to destroy such a marvel of bioengineering, but with the heart stilled, the rest of the arcology and the Valley will be safe.</p></blockquote><p>Complete all story and interlude missions except for <mission>RATTLING THE CAGE</mission>.

At the very least, you'll need to learn more about how the heart operates and why the Estians created it. Maybe some records still exist after all this time. Given their proximity to the Cage, perhaps you can find more information in the other locations on this level of the arcology.</p></blockquote><p>Gain the <mission>TO THE HEART OF IT</mission> mission.</p>",
