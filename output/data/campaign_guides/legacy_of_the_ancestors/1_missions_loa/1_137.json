However, as you follow it, you start to see the pattern; the voices move like a wave, crashing towards you before receding back into the network. You wait, timing your effort to when the voice is closest. Then you reach out with your mind, pinning the voice in place with a pointed query as to its identity. </p><p>The voice responds with surprise. \u201cThis is Yara Mercir. I\u2019m a Ranger with an expedition that set out to explore the arcology. I think I\u2019ve been down here awhile though. Too long maybe. Who are you?\u201d</p></blockquote><p><b>If you are on THE EXPEDITION\u2019S PATH, continue reading:</b></p><blockquote id=\"narration_3\"><p>You feel a thrill run through you. You hadn\u2019t dared hope that you\u2019d find one of the members of the lost expedition alive. Even if you\u2019re unsure that Yara is technically alive, she can still talk. A talking mushroom! This means Silaro could actually get some answers directly from a member of the previous expedition! Before you report back, however, you should probably do some more investigating of your own.</p></blockquote><p>Check off the middle bubble next to <b>THE EXPEDITION\u2019S PATH</b> on the campaign tracker.</p><span color=\"red\">B) \u2666\u2666\u2662</span><blockquote id=\"narration_4\"><p>Yara\u2019s voice has a hollow, echoing quality that resonates oddly with the background murmur of other voices, but you can still hear the confusion in her tone. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly how I got here,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember I had been hurt. It was bad. I hid in the fungal forest, but I had lost a lot of blood, and I just wanted to sleep. I remember that I had a very vivid dream, but I can't remember the details. I just remember there being mushrooms. Mountains of mushrooms. Then I woke up here. Wherever \u2018here\u2019 is. You\u2019re from the Valley? Do you know where I am, and how long I\u2019ve been here?\u201d </p><p>Your heart sinks, even as Yara\u2019s story confirms your suspicions. She must have died in the fungal forest, and at the moment of her death, her intellect was absorbed by the mycelial network. You've never heard of mushrooms with this kind of capabilities. They must be the result of another Estian experiment, designed to preserve their consciousness. </p></blockquote><span color=\"red\">C) \u2666\u2666\u2666</span><blockquote id=\"narration_5\"><p>You spend long moments conversing with Yara, theorizing on what you believe happened to her. Eventually, the former Ranger\u2019s confusion lessens, and you can hear acceptance in her voice. \u201cWell, maybe this whole situation was a gift in disguise,\u201d Yara says. \u201cI may be dead, but at least something of who I was can live on, albeit as a mushroom.\u201d</p><p>You laugh despite yourself, and then Yara\u2019s voice takes on a thoughtful tone. \u201cI'd like to offer you a gift for helping me. Do you see those little glowing green mushrooms over there?\u201d </p><p>You look around and spot them. \u201cGood!\u201d she says. \u201cThose mushrooms have special qualities. If you burn them as an incense, and inhale the smoke, I reckon that you'll find plants to be a lot more relatable. Farewell!\u201d </p></blockquote><p>Gain the Mycelial Incense reward card.
