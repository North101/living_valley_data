Or, at least what passes for day in this sunless place,\u201d Kal Iver says. \u201cHow are you faring?\u201d</p><p>You let him know what you\u2019ve been up to, and he nods, then relays his own explorations. \u201cAll in all, I think I\u2019ve explored at least 10 kilometers of passageways today,\u201d he finishes. A pause, then he continues, his voice turning a bit more lighthearted. \u201cHow many kilometers have you gone?\u201d When you tell him, you see a faint smile creep into his expression. \u201cWell, I was going to see if you could keep up with me on this next leg of my explorations,\u201d Kal says. \u201cBut perhaps you\u2019re feeling a bit too worn out?\u201d </p></blockquote><p><i color=\"blue\">Clear Kal with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to challenge him to a race.</i></p>",
