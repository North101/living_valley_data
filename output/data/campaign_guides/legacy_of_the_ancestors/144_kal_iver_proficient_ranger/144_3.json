As the aches fade from your muscles, you hear footsteps from one of the passageways up ahead. In a moment, you see a bobbing light, then a familiar figure in a blue Ranger's cloak rounds the corner. </p><p>\"Good day! Or, at least what passes for day in this sunless place,\" Kal Iver says. \"How are you faring?\"</p><p>You let him know what you've been up to, and he nods, then relays his own explorations. \"All in all, I think I've explored at least 10 kilometers of passageways today,\" he finishes. A pause, then he continues, his voice turning a bit more lighthearted. \"How many kilometers have you gone?\" When you tell him, you see a faint smile creep into his expression. \"Well, I was going to see if you could keep up with me on this next leg of my explorations,\" Kal says. \"But perhaps you're feeling a bit too worn out?\" </p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear Kal with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to challenge him to a race.</i></p>",
