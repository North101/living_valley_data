I'll wait over in the safety of that passage.\"</p><p>Kal heads off, but can't stop himself from shifting one more piece of rubble on his way out.</p></blockquote><p>Add 3 <span><icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon></span> to a feature, then attach Kal to <b>BURIED SURVEY TEAM</b> facedown and check off his corresponding bubble.</p><p color=\"red\">Helping Hand is attached:</p><blockquote><p>You run through the passageways, quickly choosing a different route from Kal as you strive to beat him to the arteries. Several times you find yourself moving along the bottom of large arched caverns, only to catch sight of Kal traversing some scaffolding or suspended walkway near the ceiling. </p><p>Now, however, you realize you haven\u2019t seen or heard Kal for over an hour. You\u2019re guessing he\u2019s pulled ahead of you. You doubt you\u2019ll be able to win the race to the arteries, but maybe you can meet up with him later and challenge him to a rematch. </p></blockquote><p>Discard Kal Iver.
