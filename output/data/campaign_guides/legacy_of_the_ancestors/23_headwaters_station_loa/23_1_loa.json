  "content": "<blockquote><p>You were told the waters of Headwaters Station had magical properties, and when you dive into the deep blue pool, you can see why. The water is cold but not unpleasant, and you feel tingles run down your arms as effervescent bubbles play across your skin. </p><p>As you swim deeper, the darkness seems to be illuminated by an expanse of gleaming sand, but as you swim closer, you realize that it\u2019s a field of stars. </p><p>You plunge into the starry expanse, the shapes moving with you and carrying you along. Then, as you begin to rise back upwards, you unexpectedly break the surface, finding yourself in a pocket of air trapped in an underwater cave. The cave glitters with an ethereal light, and you look up to see the same stars glittering across the ceiling of this cave. You step from the water and onto fine sand, enraptured by the starscape above.</p><p>When you finally break from your reverie, you turn back to the water and find it gone. You stand in a sea of sand under the earth, but that doesn\u2019t bother you as much as you think it should. Somehow you know you were meant to be here, and that you will find your way in this strange place.</p></blockquote><p>You may immediately proceed to the travel phase and travel to the Desert of Endless Night (even if there are ready cards with the Obstacle keyword in play). Build the path deck using the Flooded Ruins terrain set. If you choose to travel in this way, discard the current challenge card and do not resolve the remainder of this test.</p><p>If you choose not to travel, add <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to Headwaters Station equal to your effort and resolve challenge effects as normal.</p>",
