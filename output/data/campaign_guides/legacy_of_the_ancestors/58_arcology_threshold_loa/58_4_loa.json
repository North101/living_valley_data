He nods.</p><p>\u201cMost of the expeditionary team is still here in the threshold, as you can see, including yours truly,\u201d he says. \u201cSilaro left with an advance team not but two days past. He could barely contain his excitement when the Elders approved his petition. He almost ran off without so much as a rope or a candle!\u201d He chuckles to himself. \u201cCome with me,\u201d he says.</p><p>Al Grim leads you to an area deeper within the threshold, where suspended orbs of light are all that chase away the encroaching darkness. He looks you up and down for a moment, opens a crate, and begins handing you supplies.</p><p>\u201cYou look to be well-equipped, but traversing the arcology isn\u2019t the same as patrolling the Valley. For one, it\u2019s almost entirely uncharted, so you need to be prepared for anything! Next, and most importantly, it can be darker than even a moonless night, so you\u2019ll need a light source.\u201d At that he pauses. \u201cI\u2019ll be planted! It looks like the advance team took the last of the lambance rigs! You\u2019ll need to get by on whatever natural light there is for now.</p><p>\u201cWell, I must return to my duties,\u201d Al Grim says after he\u2019s certain you have everything else you need. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll see you down there! Good luck!\u201d</p></blockquote><p>You may immediately proceed to the travel phase and travel to the Chimney (even if there are ready cards with the Obstacle keyword in play). If you do, build the path deck using the Ancient Ruins terrain set. If you choose to travel in this way, discard the current challenge card, and do not resolve the remainder of this test.</p><p>After traveling, add <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to the location equal to the number of Rangers.</p><p>If you choose not to travel, discard the Arcology Threshold and resolve the remainder of the test as normal.</p>",
