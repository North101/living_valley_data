Every one of them passed through this threshold on their way down into the arcology ruin, and the signs of their passage are still evident today. The parts of the carbon-forged exterior not dissolved by the corrosive saliva of the reclaimer grubs are covered in crisscrossing claw marks of the seekers.

However, this area is filled with people going about another purpose.</p></blockquote><p>If you're on <mission>THE DESCENT</mission>, go to <a href=\"campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/58_arcology_threshold_loa/58_2_loa\"><entry>58.2</entry></a>.
