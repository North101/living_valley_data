  "content": "<blockquote><p>You\u2019ve never seen the Arcology Threshold bustling with so much activity in all your life. Villagers of all ages come and go, some carrying supplies and equipment for the expedition, others simply observing the spectacle. You imagine that this is what it must have been like when Sal Orlin led his expedition into the arcology over a century ago: a community gathered for a singular purpose, prepared to venture into the unknown, unsure of what they might find or what fate awaits them.</p><p>Amid the throng, you spot a broad-shouldered man carrying a notation scroll, directing traffic and taking inventory of the supplies as they arrive. As you approach, he looks up from his work and smiles. \u201cWelcome!\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve met. Al Grim\u2019s the name. The Elders put me in charge of gathering and organizing the supplies for Silaro\u2019s expedition.\u201d</p><p>A boy pushing a hoversled laden with carbonforged crates passes you on your left, making for a cordoned-off section of the threshold. Al Grim turns and calls after him, \u201cNot that way, Nojj! Your other left! That\u2019s it. Well done, boy!\u201d He turns back to you. \u201cLike my mother always says, once a shepherd, always a shepherd. Now, what can I do for you?\u201d</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear the Arcology Threshold with <icon icon=\"ranger_token\">&nbsp;</icon> to talk to Al Grim and travel to the Chimney.</i></p>",
