  "content": "<blockquote id=\"narration_1\"><p>At first the cavern reminds you of a dried riverbed, as unusual as that seems. The stairway takes you to a broad platform surrounded by broken railing, save for one section that simply drops off with little warning. The platform appears to lead nowhere\u2014it simply sits several meters above the ground, with no apparent function. A segment of wall is covered in large flowsteel panels, some of which still have power.</p><p>When you activate the panels, the rippling metal forms into a recognizable map of the arcology, bisected by tunnels. You find your own location, then realize that your first impression was not entirely wrong. This appears to be some sort of underground road, dotted with periodic stations like the one you stand in.</p></blockquote>",
