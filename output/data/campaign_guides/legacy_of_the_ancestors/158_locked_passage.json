At first nothing happens, but then you hear a loud \u201cthunk\u201d as the mechanisms behind the massive door spring to life. Then, with a grinding squeal that sets your teeth on edge, the portal slowly opens, revealing a darkened passageway beyond, leading you deeper into the arcology ruin.</p></blockquote><p>You can travel from this location along routes locked by the <icon icon=\"locked_passage\">&nbsp;</icon> icon. Discard all <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> from Locked Passage and attach it facedown to the current location as a reminder. When you travel, return Locked Passage to the general set.</p>",
