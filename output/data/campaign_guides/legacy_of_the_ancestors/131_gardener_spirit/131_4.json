You get a strong feeling that she wants you to accompany her there.</p></blockquote><choice id=\"rangers-choose\">Rangers Choose</choice><p><b><span color=\"red\">A) Accompany the spirit.</span></b> Discard all <span><icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon></span> from the Gardener Spirit and attach the mission <b>HELPING HAND</b> to her. <i><span color=\"blue\">Travel to the Arboretum of Memory and clear the Gardener Spirit with <span><icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon></span> while New Growth is in play.</span></i></p><p><b><span color=\"red\">B) Another time perhaps.</span></b> Discard the Gardener Spirit.
