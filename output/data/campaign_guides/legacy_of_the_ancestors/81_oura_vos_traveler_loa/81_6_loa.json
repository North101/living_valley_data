Well, my daughter Quisi and my husband Harlan have joined it too!\u201d </p><p>You ask her why she didn\u2019t join her family, and she sighs. \u201cHonestly? I would have, but I can\u2019t stand caves. I once went into the arcology\u2019s atrium and my skin got all clammy and I felt like I was choking. No, open sky is what I need, thank you!</p><p>\u201cHowever, as long as Quisi and Harlan are down below, I\u2019m going to take some time to try something I\u2019ve been thinking about doing for a long time.\u201d You ask her what that is, and her eyes gleam. \u201cOh, I\u2019m going to try to free climb the Plummet!\u201d </p><p>Your face must have shown some surprise, because she holds up her hand and laughs. \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t want to slip and fall to my death, so I asked Dace to spot me using her shaper ability to manipulate the air. Actually \u2026 if you end up in Spire and you see Dace, can you tell her to hurry up? I don\u2019t want to spend days camping out there waiting for her.\u201d </p><p>She thinks for a moment, then looks at you with suddenly serious eyes. \u201cOh, and when you\u2019re down in the arcology, can you keep an eye out for Quisi and Harlan? I swear my daughter grows more and more like him each day. There\u2019s always a chance one of them is going to get the other in trouble.\u201d </p></blockquote><p>Discard Oura.
