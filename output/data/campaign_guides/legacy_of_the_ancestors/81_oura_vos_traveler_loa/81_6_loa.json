Well, my daughter Quisi and my husband Harlan have joined it too!\" </p><p>You ask her why she didn't join her family, and she sighs. \"Honestly? I would have, but I can't stand caves. I once went into the arcology's atrium and my skin got all clammy and I felt like I was choking. No, open sky is what I need, thank you!</p><p>\"However, as long as Quisi and Harlan are down below, I'm going to take some time to try something I've been thinking about doing for a long time.\" You ask her what that is, and her eyes gleam. \"Oh, I'm going to try to free climb the Plummet!\" </p><p>Your face must have shown some surprise, because she holds up her hand and laughs. \"Oh, don't worry. I don't want to slip and fall to my death, so I asked Dace to spot me using her shaper ability to manipulate the air. Actually \u2026 if you end up in Spire and you see Dace, can you tell her to hurry up? I don't want to spend days camping out there waiting for her.\" </p><p>She thinks for a moment, then looks at you with suddenly serious eyes. \"Oh, and when you're down in the arcology, can you keep an eye out for Quisi and Harlan? I swear my daughter grows more and more like him each day. There's always a chance one of them is going to get the other in trouble.\" </p></blockquote><p>Discard Oura.
