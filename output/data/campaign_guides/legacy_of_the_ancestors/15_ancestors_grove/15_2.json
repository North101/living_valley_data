Each of the trees in this grove, from the smallest sapling to the towering giants at the grove\u2019s center, has been planted in memory of a loved one. Often, that loved one has been interned beneath the roots of their tree. </p><p>Near the edges of the grove, you see one sapling that has only just sprouted. You recognize the memorial site for Kasende, the dauntless hydraworm hunter. Her body was not buried here, having been lost in the Marsh of Rebirth during the great fight to lead the reclaimers into the jaws of the hydraworms. What is there, clustered around the sapling trunk, are the countless gifts, flowers, and mementos left by the people of the Valley. She died a hero, and you know her memorial will never go unadorned.</p></blockquote>",
