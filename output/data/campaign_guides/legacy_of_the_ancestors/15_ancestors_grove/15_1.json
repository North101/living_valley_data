Each of the trees in this grove, from the smallest sapling to the towering giants at the grove's center, has been planted in memory of a loved one. Often, that loved one has been interned beneath the roots of their tree. </p><p>Near the edges of the grove, you see one sapling that has only just sprouted. You recognize the memorial site for Aell, the young shaper. His body was not buried here, having been lost in his last stand to remove the reclaimers and save the Valley. What is there, clustered around the sapling trunk, are the countless gifts, flowers, and mementos left by the people of the Valley. He died a hero, and you know his memorial will never go unadorned.</p></blockquote>",
