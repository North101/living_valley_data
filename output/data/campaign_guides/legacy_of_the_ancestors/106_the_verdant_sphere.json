All is stained and weathered, and has long ago fallen apart. You find several species of plant growing here that you recognize from the surface, and a few that you don\u2019t. Here also grow the large carnivorous plants that move with an intelligence that belies their appearance.</p><p>It is only upon entering the sphere itself that you are able to venture a guess as to the former function of this place. Wondrous machines lie about a vast open arena in various states of disrepair, and you imagine that this is where the Estians engineered their biomelds like the spindlescuttlers, hydraworms, and countless others.</p></blockquote><p>If you are on <b>TO THE HEART OF IT</b> and haven\u2019t received or completed the <b>OVERGROWN</b> mission, go to <a href=\"campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/106_the_verdant_sphere/106_1\">106.1</a>.</p>",
