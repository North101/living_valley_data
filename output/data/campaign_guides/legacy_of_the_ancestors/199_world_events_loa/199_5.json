Or her father's?\" He playfully harrumphs. \"Lucky for you, I rescued myself. Though it took some time to dig out Quisi and Harlan. Once they were safe, I tried to convince them to go back to the surface, but they wouldn't hear it. Though I suppose it's not much safer up there right now, what with the electric fog everywhere.\"</p><p>Kal sighs. \"But that's not why I'm here. Silaro's found something in the old Estian records. There appears to be some sort of apparatus in the very depths of the arcology, in a chamber the Estians called 'the Cage.' We need to get down there and find out what it is. It's possible that it's some sort of ... engine for the arcology. Silaro believes that it's responsible for these quakes.\" </p></blockquote><p>Record <event>KAL SAVED THE TEAM</event> on the campaign tracker. Complete the <mission>COLLAPSE!
