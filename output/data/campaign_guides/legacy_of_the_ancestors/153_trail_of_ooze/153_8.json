Instead of shifting into another predator of the Valley, it takes on a form that appears to be its actual self\u2014a small and vulnerable slug-like being. </p><p>As you approach it carefully, you realize that the shapeshifting ability must be the entity\u2019s defense mechanism. By appearing to be a much larger and more fearsome predator, it can probably scare off most things that want to eat it. </p></blockquote><p>Discard Trail of Ooze and return <b>FOLLOWING A LEAD</b> to the collection.
