You're trying to decide what the best way to capture it would be (or if it's even worthwhile to do so) when you notice ripples flowing down its outer surface. Slowly, sinuously, limbs elongate out of the blob, the surface takes on a darker color and rougher texture, and a head begins to emerge. The blob is transforming into something else entirely! </p></blockquote><p>Search the Mountain Pass set for a Pouncing Atrox, the Old-Growth set for a Dozing Bearsloth, and the Grassland set for a Bloodbeckoned Velox and a Hungry Scrof. Shuffle these together to form the Shapeshifter deck. Draw a being from the Shapeshifter deck and put it into play. Attach Trail of Ooze to that being.</p><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear the shapeshifting being with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to subdue it.</i></p>",
