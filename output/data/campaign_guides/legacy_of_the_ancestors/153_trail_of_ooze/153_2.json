After a moment you realize that the interior and exterior of the shattered glass are covered in a thick, translucent goo that still glistens in the light of your lambance rigs. Then you see a trail of the same substance heading away from you. This cylinder must have broken recently. More importantly, whatever was in it has escaped. </p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear the Trail of Ooze with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to track it.</i></p>",
