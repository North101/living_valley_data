  "content": "<blockquote id=\"narration_1\"><p>Nal strides to the center of the knoll with a surety of purpose. She shakes a carbon-forged rattle, and calls upon the seven directions, the spirits of the elements, and the spirit of the Valley. She kneels and traces her hands lightly over the chiseled threads in the stone, then she places her hands lightly upon it, sits, and closes her eyes. You set aside your pack and sit quietly across from her. She speaks. Her voice carrying an almost dreamlike quality.</p><p>\"Interesting,\" she says. \"I can sense the presence from before, but it remains elusive. But there are others. Three, specifically. The spirits of Estians, bound to their former lives, unable or unwilling to cross over. I see three of them, and all are in need of assistance, though they might resist.\" </p><p>The sun moves steadily across the sky, and eventually Nal opens her eyes.</p><p>\"There's nothing I can do for them from here unfortunately,\" she says. \"I tried, but there is still something standing between us; something that doesn't appreciate me snooping around in the arcology. I'm unsure of what or who it could be.\" </p><p>You hand her your canteen, and she smiles in thanks. \"You know,\" Nal says. \"If you happen across those spirits while you're exploring the arcology, you may be able to communicate with them. And, if you feel up to it, you may even be able to help them come to terms with their deaths so they can finally be at peace. Then, maybe, they'll be willing to cross over.\" </p></blockquote><p>Gain Echoes of the Estians reward card. Discard Nal and return <mission>HELPING HAND</mission> to the collection.
