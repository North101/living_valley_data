Even as you clutch the seed protectively in your arms, a small part of you wonders why it has brought you here. Then you're standing just behind the cascade, buffeted by gusts of cold, spray-soaked wind, and you feel the impulses flowing through you change. Instead of protecting it, the seed now wants you to \u2026 throw it away? </p><p>You feel a sudden compulsion to hurl the seed from you. You struggle against it for a moment, then give up and throw the seed into the crashing water where instantly it is swept away towards the deep jungles of the Verdessa. As the seed's influence leaves your mind, you're surprised to feel a wave of gratitude sweep over you. You think that perhaps you've gained something in your time with this strange plant. </p></blockquote><p>Gain the <reward>Bursting with Life</reward> reward.
