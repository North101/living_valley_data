You look around and see a flickering light moving through the trees. </p><p>You step closer, then stop. A figure is walking there, moving from tree to tree and occasionally passing through them. At first, you see a bearded man, wearing strange clothes, and stranger gear, but then he seems also to be made up of flashes of different people, places, and even emotions, although if asked how you \"see\" emotions in the spirit, you could not say. Something about the colors and shapes, and the way they shift and move, speaks to you in a strange and marvelous language.</p></blockquote><p><i><span class=\"text text_blue\">Clear this spirit with <span><icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon></span> to interpret its strange appearance.</span></i></p>",
