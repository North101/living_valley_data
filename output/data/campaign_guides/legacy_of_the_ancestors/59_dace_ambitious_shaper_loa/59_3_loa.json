Well, with Harlan and Quisi traveling on their own, I guess she's decided to have her own adventure. She's planning on free climbing the Plummet!\" </p><p>You can't help but feel impressed as you remember the towering cliff rising above the Valley. Did Oura approach Dace because that's where Dace learned to shape the winds and fly? </p><p>Dace shakes her head. \"No, no. Every time I've visited the Plummet, I've either been flying above it or falling past it! I wouldn't know the first thing about climbing the cliff.\" </p><p>She pauses for a moment, and you see a hint of the old nervousness in her eyes. \"I \u2026 don't suppose you'd be willing to come with me? Watch Oura make her big climb?\"  </p></blockquote><p><b color=\"red\">A) Accompany Dace to the Plummet.</b> Discard all <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> from Dace and attach <mission>HELPING HAND</mission>.
