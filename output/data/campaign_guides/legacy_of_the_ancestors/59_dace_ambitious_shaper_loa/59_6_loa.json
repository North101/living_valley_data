As you can see,\" she says as she hops upward, a small jump that turns into a graceful bound over your heads, \"I'm getting pretty good at it.\"</p><p>\u201cHowever,\u201d she smiles wryly, \u201cmost of my time is spent deep in meditation. As the shapers say, \u2018you can\u2019t shape the world around you without understanding the shape of your own spirit.\u2019 I admit, it\u2019s been helpful.\u201d </p><p>You agree, noting that her control seems to be much better. Dace bows slightly. \u201cThank you! And I guess that means I\u2019d better get back to it, huh?\u201d </p><p>She bids you farewell and leaps into the air, vanishing into the sky with a puff of wind.</p></blockquote><p>Discard Dace.
