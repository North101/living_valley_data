As you can see,\" she says as she hops upward, a small jump that turns into a graceful bound over your heads, \"I'm getting pretty good at it.\"</p><p>\"However,\" she smiles wryly, \"most of my time is spent deep in meditation. As the shapers say, 'you can't shape the world around you without understanding the shape of your own spirit.' I admit, it's been helpful.\" </p><p>You agree, noting that her control seems to be much better. Dace bows slightly. \"Thank you! And I guess that means I'd better get back to it, huh?\" </p><p>She bids you farewell and leaps into the air, vanishing into the sky with a puff of wind.</p></blockquote><p>Discard Dace. Search the Spire deck for the Arcology Threshold and put it into play.</p>",
