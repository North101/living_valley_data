I spend a lot of my time meditating, and I make a steady trip up to Aell's memorial in the Grove.\" Her smile turns a bit wry for a moment. \"Admittedly, that's easier to do when you can fly.\" </p><p>She stares over the Valley for a moment, gathering her thoughts. \"You know, it's strange. Since his body got washed away, it's hard to believe he's really dead. Sometimes, when I hear a really close thunderstrike, I look up, half expecting to see Aell with that impish grin on his face.\" </p><p>She shakes her head. \"But the Spirit Speakers all say his spirit is at peace. And that is certainly a lot.\" </p><p>You nod silently, remembering the last time you saw Aell\u2014his arms spread wide as he summoned the storm, standing defiantly as the waters swirled around him, refusing to cease his call until the reclaimers were all washed away, even as the waters swept him from view. After a minute, you mention that his legacy is one the Valley will remember for generations. </p><p>\"Thank you,\" Dace says. \"Well, I should be going. I hope your expedition fares well, and be safe.\" </p></blockquote><p>Discard Dace. Each Ranger soothes 1 fatigue. Search the Spire deck for the Arcology Threshold and put it into play.</p>",
