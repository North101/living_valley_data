I spend a lot of my time meditating, and I make a steady trip up to Aell\u2019s memorial in the Grove.\u201d Her smile turns a bit wry for a moment. \u201cAdmittedly, that\u2019s easier to do when you can fly.\u201d </p><p>She stares over the Valley for a moment, gathering her thoughts. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s strange. Since his body got washed away, it\u2019s hard to believe he\u2019s really dead. Sometimes, when I hear a really close thunderstrike, I look up, half expecting to see Aell with that impish grin on his face.\u201d </p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cBut the Spirit Speakers all say his spirit is at peace. And that is certainly a lot.\u201d </p><p>You nod silently, remembering the last time you saw Aell\u2014his arms spread wide as he summoned the storm, standing defiantly as the waters swirled around him, refusing to cease his call until the reclaimers were all washed away, even as the waters swept him from view. After a minute, you mention that his legacy is one the Valley will remember for generations. </p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Dace says. \u201cWell, I should be going. I hope your expedition fares well, and be safe.\u201d </p></blockquote><p>Discard Dace. Each Ranger soothes 1 fatigue. Search the Spire deck for the Arcology Threshold and put it into play.</p>",
