Plenty of opportunities for us to use our talents, and even when there aren't, the townsfolk can always benefit from a couple extra pairs of hands.\" She opens her palms, and you smile to see the thick calluses. </p><p>\"You know it's funny,\" Dace continues after a moment, \"but even when we're hauling beams or shifting bags of rubble, the work feels so \u2026 satisfying! And working alongside Aell, well, it's honestly brought us closer together than we've been in years. That alone makes me grateful.\"</p><p>You note that the work rebuilding Spire has been going well, and Dace nods in agreement. \"I just wish the Shapers up on Blind Peak would come down to help out too,\" she adds. \"But on the other hand, perhaps Elder Cress feels like Aell and I are the appropriate amount of aid.\"</p><p>You acknowledge that it might be so, and also note how inscrutable Cress tends to be. Dace laughs. \"That's the truth! Might as well try and talk to a thunderstorm. But anyway, I'd better be off. More work to do, you know. Good luck on your adventures!\" </p><p>A puff of wind, and she's gone. </p></blockquote><p>Discard Dace. Each Ranger soothes 2 fatigue. Search the Spire deck for the Arcology Threshold and put it into play. Then, each Ranger may place their <icon icon=\"ranger_token\">&nbsp;</icon> on it.</p>",
