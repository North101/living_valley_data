  "content": "<blockquote><p>The tunnel led far away from the main passages of the arcology. You found yourself climbing up and down sharp inclines, weaving between towering columns that hum with concealed energies, and squeezing through ventilation shafts that vent gusts of freezing air. Eventually, however, you emerge into a network of vents. These could be used to get to nearby locations very quickly!</p></blockquote><p>You may immediately proceed to the travel phase of the round (even if there are ready cards with the Obstacle keyword in play). If you do, you can travel to any location within 2 paths (the standard rules for locks still apply). Use the terrain type of the last path you crossed over. If you choose to travel in this way, discard the current challenge card and do not resolve the remainder of this test.</p><p>If you choose not to travel, discard the Rift in the Artery and resolve the remainder of the test as normal.</p>",
