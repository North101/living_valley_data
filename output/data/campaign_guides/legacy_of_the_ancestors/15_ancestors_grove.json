Each of the trees, from the smallest sapling to the towering giants at the grove\u2019s center, has been planted over the final resting place of a loved one. You move with care through the grove. You see several people, some keeping to themselves, some speaking softly, some bearing gifts, all here to commune with those who have passed. You pause and give thought to your ancestors.</p></blockquote>",
