I didn\u2019t recognize you for a minute.\u201d She moves up to you and clasps your hands, your bones creaking in her powerful, gnarled grip. </p><p>\u201cGlad to see you. I thought I heard you were heading through here. Something about that expedition heading down into the arcology?\u201d </p><p>You tell her about your new duties, and she grunts. \u201cGood thing you\u2019re heading along, Silaro too often has his head in the clouds. All right, good luck. Wish I could sit around and gab, but me and every one of my artificers are busy repairing Spire. Plus making all the supplies for Silaro\u2019s expedition! Be safe!\u201d </p><p>She heads off, shoving her sled and whistling cheerily. </p></blockquote><p>Discard Elder Orlin. Each Ranger soothes 2 fatigue. Search the Spire deck for the Arcology Threshold and put it into play. Then, each Ranger may place their <icon icon=\"ranger_token\">&nbsp;</icon> on it.</p>",
