For a moment, the information is far too chaotic to interpret, but then it resolves into a complex but orderly tree of data that you can navigate. </p><p>You start sorting through the information. It appears that the petrified tree contains a wealth of information about the arcology, specifically about the structure\u2019s construction and expansion. It all seems to have been logged by someone named <span color=\"blue\">ARCHIVIST RAL</span>, and this person\u2019s notes cover generations of development. You realize that the most difficult part of this process isn\u2019t going to be accessing the data, but sorting through the entries to find the most valuable bits! </p><p>The database lists excavation efforts throughout the generations. Each entry is sorted by the arcology population at the time of the excavation and the method used for the excavation. By inputting those two pieces of data, you can look up different bits of stored history.
