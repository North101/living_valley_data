Now we\u2019re in.\u201d </p><p>He unslings his pack and begins withdrawing the disassembled parts of his longbow. As he puts them together, he continues speaking.</p><p>\u201cThe Estians needed a means of traveling through their arcology. You\u2019d think they\u2019d make some sort of pincrawler or motorized cart, but that didn't match their sheer audacity, oh no! They took a spindlescuttler, then they made it even bigger. And once it was huge enough, they got to work with their biological tricks and grew compartments on their creation, and even clear panels to serve as windows! And that\u2019s how they made their scuttlebus.\u201d</p><p>Kordo finishes the assembly, experimentally notches an arrow and pulls on the string. Satisfied, he turns back to you. \u201cI\u2019ve heard it\u2019s as lethal as a spindlescuttler, and twice as hungry. Look for it wherever it lurks!\u201d Then he stalks down the arcology corridor and vanishes into the dark.</p></blockquote><p>Gain the Audacity of the Estians reward card.
