Now we're in.\" </p><p>He unslings his pack and begins withdrawing the disassembled parts of his longbow. As he puts them together, he continues speaking.</p><p>\"The Estians needed a means of traveling through their arcology. You'd think they'd make some sort of pincrawler or motorized cart, but that didn't match their sheer audacity, oh no! They took a spindlescuttler, then they made it even bigger. And once it was huge enough, they got to work with their biological tricks and grew compartments on their creation, and even clear panels to serve as windows! And that's how they made their scuttlebus.\"</p><p>Kordo finishes the assembly, experimentally notches an arrow and pulls on the string. Satisfied, he turns back to you. \"I've heard it's as lethal as a spindlescuttler, and twice as hungry. Look for it wherever it lurks!\" Then he stalks down the arcology corridor and vanishes into the dark.</p></blockquote><p>Gain the <reward>Audacity of the Estians</reward> reward card.
