Beneath them you find a narrow passageway that leads into a steeply sloping vertical descent. As you eye the pitch darkness ahead, you\u2019re sure this must be the way!</p></blockquote><p>You may immediately proceed to the travel phase of the round (even if there are ready cards with the Obstacle keyword in play). If you do, you can travel to either the Drenching Chamber or the Scuttler Network. Build the path deck using the Cave System terrain set. If you choose to travel in this way, discard the current challenge card and do not resolve the remainder of this test. </p><p>If you choose not to travel, discard the Arcology Sinkhole and resolve the remainder of the test as normal.</p>",
