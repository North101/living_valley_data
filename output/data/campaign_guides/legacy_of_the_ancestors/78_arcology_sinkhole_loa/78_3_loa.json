If you do, you can travel to either the Drenching Chamber or the Scuttler Network. Build the path deck using the Cave System terrain set. If you choose to travel in this way, discard the current challenge card and do not resolve the remainder of this test. </p><p>If you choose not to travel, discard the Arcology Sinkhole and resolve the remainder of the test as normal.</p>",
