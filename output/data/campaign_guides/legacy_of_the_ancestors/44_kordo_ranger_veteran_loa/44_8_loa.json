Well, you\u2019ll need something strong to fortify you before you encounter the really nasty things down in the arcology.\u201d </p><p>The old Ranger proceeds to tell you about the dangerous biomelds and other predators you may encounter in the arcology. His stories range from repulsive carrion and garbage eaters to strange robotic guardians and, of course, the fearsome spindlescuttlers. Unsurprisingly, the gigantic insectoids love to inhabit the arcology\u2019s tunnels. </p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s one, a really big scuttler, that\u2019s apparently even bigger than Ol\u2019 Bloody Clicker himself,\u201d Kordo says. \u201cI guess it\u2019s some sort of biomeld, created by the Estians for who knows what reason.\u201d He thinks for a long moment. \u201cYou know, that would be a great hunt. I remember finding some of those really deep sinkholes back in my patrolling days. I think some of them might get all the way down to the arcology, even.\u201d</p></blockquote><choice id=\"rangers-choose\">RANGERS CHOOSE</choice><p><span color=\"red\">A) Help Kordo find a sinkhole down to the arcology.</span> Discard all <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> and attach the <b>HELPING HAND</b> mission to Kordo.</p><p><span color=\"red\">B) Some other time.</span> Discard Kordo.
