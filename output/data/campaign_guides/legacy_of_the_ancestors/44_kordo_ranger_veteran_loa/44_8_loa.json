Well, you'll need something strong to fortify you before you encounter the really nasty things down in the arcology.\" </p><p>The old Ranger proceeds to tell you about the dangerous biomelds and other predators you may encounter in the arcology. His stories range from repulsive carrion and garbage eaters to strange robotic guardians and, of course, the fearsome spindlescuttlers. Unsurprisingly, the gigantic insectoids love to inhabit the arcology's tunnels. </p><p>\"And there's one, a really big scuttler, that's apparently even bigger than Ol' Bloody Clicker himself,\" Kordo says. \"I guess it's some sort of biomeld, created by the Estians for who knows what reason.\" He thinks for a long moment. \"You know, that would be a great hunt. I remember finding some of those really deep sinkholes back in my patrolling days. I think some of them might get all the way down to the arcology, even.\"</p></blockquote><p><span color=\"red\">A) Help Kordo find a sinkhole down to the arcology.</span> Discard all <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> and attach the <mission>HELPING HAND</mission> mission to Kordo.</p><p><span color=\"red\">B) Some other time.</span> Discard Kordo.
