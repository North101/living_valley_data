Before you can say hello, you hear the clop of stilthorse hooves outside. Soon after, the double doors to the mud room swing open and Zek Tsal stomps in, water running in rivers off his hat and cloak.</p><p>\"Ho there!\" he says cheerfully. \"It's a fine day for a ride. A fine day!\" </p><p>\"Hello, Zek!\" says Kordo. \"What news from the trail?\" </p><p>Zek removes his cloak and starts the hopeless process of shaking it dry. \"Everyone is all abuzz about the expedition, of course,\" he says, frowning at his drenched garments. \"I've also heard that Ren Kobo is hosting a swap meet at his market \u2026 starting today! Sounds like anyone with something to trade will be there. Might be worth stopping by; you could trade for some really exceptional gear! I'm headed there myself tomorrow to see about a new saddle, and maybe a water-repellent cloak.\" </p></blockquote><p>Gain the <mission>LIMITED TIME OFFER</mission> mission.
