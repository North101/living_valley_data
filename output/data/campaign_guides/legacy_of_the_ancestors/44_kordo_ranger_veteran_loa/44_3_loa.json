  "content": "<blockquote><p>You find Kordo in Lone Tree\u2019s mud room, lacing his boots, his well-stocked backpack and hunting bow sitting on the bench beside him. Before you can say hello, you hear the clop of stilthorse hooves outside. Soon after, the double doors to the mud room swing open and Zek Tsal stomps in, water running in rivers off his hat and cloak.</p><p>\u201cHo there!\u201d he says cheerfully. \u201cIt\u2019s a fine day for a ride. A fine day!\u201d </p><p>\u201cHello, Zek!\u201d says Kordo. \u201cWhat news from the trail?\u201d </p><p>Zek removes his cloak and starts the hopeless process of shaking it dry. \u201cEveryone is all abuzz about the expedition, of course,\u201d he says, frowning at his drenched garments. \u201cI\u2019ve also heard that Ren Kobo is hosting a swap meet at his market \u2026 starting today! Sounds like anyone with something to trade will be there. Might be worth stopping by; you could trade for some really exceptional gear! I\u2019m headed there myself tomorrow to see about a new saddle, and maybe a water-repellent cloak.\u201d </p></blockquote><p>Gain the <b>LIMITED TIME OFFER</b> mission.
