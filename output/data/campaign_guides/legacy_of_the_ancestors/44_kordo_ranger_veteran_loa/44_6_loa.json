So, let me tell you about some of the really nasty things you can run into down in the arcology.\u201d </p><p>You excitedly interrupt him; telling him the thrilling story of your Scuttlebus hunt. Kordo listens raptly the entire time, even forgetting to take pulls from his flask. As you complete your tale, his face breaks into a wide, amazed grin. \u201cThat\u2019s damned impressive, my friends. Damned impressive! I just wish I could have seen it. But I look forward to you retelling this tale back at the Root!\u201d </p></blockquote><p>Gain the Audacity of the Estians reward card. Discard Kordo, Ranger Veteran.</p>",
