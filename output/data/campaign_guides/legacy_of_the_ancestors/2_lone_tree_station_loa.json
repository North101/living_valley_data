  "content": "<blockquote><p>Standing high above the western shore of White Sky Lake, Lone Tree Station towers over the surrounding highland plains. The wind rustles the leaves of its great boughs, and the verdant garden boxes that hang from those branches sway in turn. Wide, well-trodden paths lead from the Station in each of the cardinal directions, and you see several cloaked figures coming and going; fellow Rangers busy with missions of their own.</p></blockquote><p>If you have <span class=\"text text_blue\">STAGED THE HUNT</span> but have not completed <b>ONE THOUSAND LEGS (WILD SCUTTLEBUS)</b>, remove Kordo, Ranger Veteran from Lone Tree Station set before constructing the path deck.</p><p><b>If <span class=\"text text_blue\">SPIRE FALLEN</span>, continue reading:</b></p><blockquote><p>You can also see the last few tents and lean-to shelters, scattered remnants of the hundreds of temporary dwellings that surrounded the base of Lone Tree for the past two cycles. Those shelters were inhabited by the displaced inhabitants of Spire, though in the past couple of weeks, many have returned to their old homes.</p></blockquote>",
