What are you up to now? Where are you headed?\"</p><p>Harlan simply chuckles.</p></blockquote><p>If Harlan Vos is not in play, search the Artery set for him and put him into play. Do not read his entry.</p><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear Quisi or Harlan with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to see how their map is coming along.</i></p>",
