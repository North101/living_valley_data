The two chat briefly as they look over a pair of scrolls made of light\u2014one gold, one pale blue. You're not sure what they're doing, but after a moment they give each other a playful high five and head off in different directions. Perhaps when you see them next you'll learn what they're up to.</p></blockquote><p>Each Ranger soothes 1 fatigue. Discard Quisi and Harlan Vos. Draw 1 path card.</p>",
