She beams up at him. \"Looks like we successfully charted a route through the artery! Now what should we do?\"</p><p>\"I told you already, Dad. I want to see what's deeper down there! I bet it's treasure!\" Harlan laughs. \"So do I. Let's see first if we can get your mom to come along. What do you say?\"</p><p>As you turn to go, Quisi pipes up. \"Wait!\" she yells. Then, solemnly, she hands you her lantern. \"If I can't see what's down there yet, then at least Slugmund can.\" The glowing slug undulates against the glass. Quisi waves goodbye.</p></blockquote><p>Discard Quisi and Harlan Vos and return <mission>HELPING HAND</mission> to the collection. Gain the <reward>Quisi's Lantern</reward> reward card.
