Several members of the expeditionary team still linger here, setting up various equipment and carrying supplies down into the Chimney. From here, you can head back up to Spire through the arcology threshold, if you wish.</p></blockquote><p>You may immediately proceed to the travel phase and travel to Spire (even if there are ready cards with the Obstacle keyword in play). If you do, build the path deck using the Ancient Ruins terrain set. If you choose to travel in this way, discard the current challenge card and do not resolve the remainder of this test.</p>",
