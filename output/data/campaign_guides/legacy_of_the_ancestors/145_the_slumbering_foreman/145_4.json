  "content": "<blockquote id=\"narration_1\"><p>You follow the machine to a room that has half a dozen bays for maintenance machines, some of which are occupied by badly rusted occupants. The air is thick with the cloying smell of ancient lubricants as you follow the machine to the back of the workshop.</p><p>Your mechanical companion stops before a rugged hatch. Then its photoreceptor flashes, and the hatch grinds open. Inside you see stacks of supplies, including carbon-forged paneling, flowsteel vats, and hundreds of esoteric components. The machine seems to think for a moment, then grabs a heavy floor panel and begins to leave. You have just a moment to grab a compact, useful-looking device and jump out of the storage bay before the hatch slams shut again.</p></blockquote><p>Gain the Portable Generator reward card.
