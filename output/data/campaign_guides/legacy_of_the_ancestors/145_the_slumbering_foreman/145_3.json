Another series of high-pitched beeps chime, but this time the machine doesn\u2019t immediately march off. Instead, several power cells eject from its casing, clattering onto the floor in front of you. Then, with a steady hum, it clumsily trudges away from you. Is it offering you a gift in return for helping it?</p></blockquote><p>Discard the Slumbering Foreman. You may distribute all power that was on it among other machines in play. Each Ranger soothes 2 fatigue.</p>",
