Then it smacks into a nearby wall and tumbles to the floor. It sits, legs sprawled in every direction, for a long moment before climbing back to its feet. You could swear you see it shake itself like a massive, clumsy dog before stomping off down the hallway.</p><p>As you follow, you think you remember that some Estian workshops lie in this direction. Maybe the machine is headed there. However, you also know that something this noisy and cumbersome is going to attract a lot of predators and other dangers.
