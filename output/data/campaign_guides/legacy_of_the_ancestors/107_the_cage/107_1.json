Then, with a rattle, it begins again, and you feel the whole arcology shake in response. To fix the heart\u2019s arrhythmia, you\u2019ll need to be as prepared as possible, for deep down you know that you will get only one chance. </p></blockquote><choice id=\"rangers-choose\">Rangers Choose</choice><p class=\"text text_red\">A) Continue working on a solution:</p><blockquote><p>You shake your head. There has to be a solution to this problem. The Estians grew the heart; they had to have created means to heal or repair it should something go wrong. You think if you find where the Estians developed the heart, you may also find answers. Alternatively, if you can gain access to their records, that may help as well.</p></blockquote><p class=\"text text_red\">B) Finish this.
