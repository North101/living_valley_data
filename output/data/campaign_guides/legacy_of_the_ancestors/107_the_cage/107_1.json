Then, with a rattle, it begins again, and you feel the whole arcology shake in response. To fix the heart's arrhythmia, you'll need to be as prepared as possible, for deep down you know that you will get only one chance. </p></blockquote><p color=\"red\">A) Continue working on a solution:</p><blockquote id=\"narration_2\"><p>You shake your head. There has to be a solution to this problem. The Estians grew the heart; they had to have created means to heal or repair it should something go wrong. You think if you find where the Estians developed the heart, you may also find answers. Alternatively, if you can gain access to their records, that may help as well.</p></blockquote><p color=\"red\">B) Finish this. You are ready to confront the Heart:</p><blockquote id=\"narration_3\"><p>You square your shoulders. There's no more time for research and planning. It is time to deal with the heart once and for all.</p></blockquote><p>Go to <a href=\"campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/107_the_cage/107_2\"><entry>107.2</entry></a></p><p color=\"red\">C) Rest and start fresh tomorrow:</p><blockquote id=\"narration_4\"><p>You know you need more time, and some rest, before you confront the heart. Withdrawing from the Cage, you find a structurally sound side tunnel and set up camp.</p></blockquote><p><b>End the day.</b> You are considered to have camped.</p>",
