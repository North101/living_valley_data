Wherever you are, you welcome the sight of clouds overhead and breathe deeply, the fresh air a tonic to your lungs. As you marvel at the exposed earthen walls, shot through with intricate root systems entangled with Estian ruins, you discover a series of climber\u2019s pitons wedged into a narrow fissure, describing a path up to the surface. Judging by the cleanliness of the pitons and the marks on the wall, you determine that someone must have climbed down here fairly recently.</p></blockquote><p>Search the General set for Lunn, Curious Scavenger and shuffle him into the path deck.</p>",
