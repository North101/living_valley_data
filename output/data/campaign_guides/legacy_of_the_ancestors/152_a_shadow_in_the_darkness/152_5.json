All the time, you stay close enough to continue the chase, but never close enough to catch them. Perhaps, you realize, that is exactly the shadowy figure\u2019s goal.</p><p>Just as you wonder if you should break off your pursuit, you emerge into a large chamber lit by dozens of phosphorescent mushrooms. There is no sign of the figure, but as you search the room, you find the walls adorned with a series of simple and elegant paintings. They depict a terrifying monster resembling a massive spindlescuttler with a bulbous head chasing a group of figures. One is caught and devoured, the rest are separated and scattered.</p><p>You don\u2019t know what this being is, or what the stranger is trying to ask of you. Perhaps if you can find a being like this and then return to him, you can glean more information.</p></blockquote><p>Discard A Shadow in the Darkness. Each Ranger soothes 2 fatigue.</p>",
