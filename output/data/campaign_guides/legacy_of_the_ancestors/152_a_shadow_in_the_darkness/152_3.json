This one looks a bit more lived-in, with a disc-shaped rock that serves as a table, and another stone slab that could be a bed. The figure invites you to sit on the floor in front of the table and begins heating something up on a portable stove. A couple of minutes later, they place a carved-out bowl of hearty mushroom stew and a cup of what appears to be steaming tea in front of you. They sit and watch from the shadows as you sip the stew cautiously. Are they trying to thank you for helping them?</p><p>As you hungrily consume the rest of the meal, you notice more paintings on the wall of this chamber. These seem a bit older. Some depict submerged passageways that seem very familiar, being navigated by figures wearing tiny rebreathers on their faces. Others depict locked doors, but next to the doors the figure has illustrated an angular, sharp-pronged device. More figures plunge the device into the center of these doors, and the doors swing open in response. </p></blockquote><p>Discard A Shadow in the Darkness.
