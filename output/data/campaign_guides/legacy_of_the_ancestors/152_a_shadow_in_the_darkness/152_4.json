  "content": "<blockquote><p>You follow the shadowy figure through tunnels and maintenance corridors, up ramps and stairwells, and across a passageway that, through flooding, has turned into a shallow underground river. All the time, you stay close enough to continue the chase, but never close enough to catch them. Perhaps, you realize, that is exactly the shadowy figure\u2019s goal.</p><p>Just as you wonder if you should break off your pursuit, you emerge into a large chamber lit by dozens of phosphorescent mushrooms. There is no sign of the figure, but as you search the room, you find the walls adorned with a series of simple and elegant paintings. They depict a terrifying monster resembling a massive spindlescuttler with a bulbous head chasing a group of figures. One is caught and devoured, the rest are separated and scattered. You recognize this being, you\u2019re sure it\u2019s the one you encountered in the arteries.</p><p>Then your eye catches the last painting in the series. This one seems very recent; when you touch the wall, your finger comes away with traces of wet pigment. You see the being again, but this time, it is being hunted by figures wearing cloaks. When you notice that the cloaks on the figures are the same color as your own, you realize what this unknown individual wants you to do. </p></blockquote><choice id=\"rangers-choose\">Rangers Choose:</choice><p><b><span color=\"red\">A) Decide to hunt the Scuttlebus for them.</span></b> Gain the <b>ONE THOUSAND LEGS (WILD SCUTTLEBUS)</b> mission.
