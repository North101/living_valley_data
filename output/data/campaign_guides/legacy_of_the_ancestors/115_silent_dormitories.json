  "content": "<blockquote id=\"narration_1\"><p>Given the vast caverns and vaulted stone cathedrals that make up the Estian arcology, you didn't expect their living quarters to be so \u2026 cozy. </p><p>However, the clusters of habitations you pick your way through are exactly that. Most are single rooms designed for one or two people, with beds, cabinets, and shelves cunningly shaped into the walls. The effect is that the rooms were somehow grown from carbonforged composites. </p><p>Most of the rooms have been somewhat or fully overgrown with moss, greenery, and the seemingly ever-present fungi, but you still find traces of their former owners. Cups and bottles sit on dust-covered shelves, warm golden light radiates from a few of the large globes inset into the walls, and in a couple of rooms, you swear you hear the faint sound of birdsong\u2014although you can't find any living birds anywhere.</p></blockquote><p><b>If you haven't received or completed the ARTIFICIAL ADAPTATION mission, continue reading:</b></p><blockquote id=\"narration_2\"><p>As you explore the habitation areas, you find one room where the bed isn't buried under a thick layer of dust. You see tracks on the floor and evidence that someone was using the shelves, but it isn't until you find bits of a disassembled Sol coil and a broken gauzeblade hilt left carelessly in a corner that you realize that this was Lunn's campsite. The Ranger certainly has made it deep into the arcology!</p></blockquote><p>Search the General set for Lunn, Curious Scavenger and shuffle him into the path deck.</p>",
