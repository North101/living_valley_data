What are you up to now? Where are you headed?\"</p><p>Harlan simply chuckles.</p></blockquote><p>If Quisi Vos is not in play, search the Artery set for her and put her into play. Do not read her entry.</p><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear either Quisi or Harlan with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to see how their map is coming along.</i></p>",
