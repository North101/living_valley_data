Now you can hear individual voices, vague and jumbled, but you still can\u2019t make out what they\u2019re saying. You wonder if you could hear them more clearly if you found a larger group of mushrooms. Perhaps you could even speak to them and get a reply. </p></blockquote><choice id=\"rangers-choose\">RANGERS CHOOSE</choice><p><b color=\"red\">A) Take on the mission of searching out mushrooms.</b> Discard the Ferrymen.
