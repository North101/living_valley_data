They're too faint to understand, so you take shallow breaths, try to ignore the mouthful of spores, and close your eyes. </p><p>You focus your spirit, and the voices begin to grow louder and more distinct, becoming a cacophony of whispers. You realize with a start that the voices aren't coming from one mushroom. They're coming from all the mushrooms. </p><p>You move towards a grove of mycelial growths, and the voices grow even stronger. Now you can hear individual voices, vague and jumbled, but you still can't make out what they're saying. You wonder if you could hear them more clearly if you found a larger group of mushrooms. Perhaps you could even speak to them and get a reply. </p></blockquote><p><b color=\"red\">A) Take on the mission of searching out mushrooms.</b> Discard the Ferrymen.
