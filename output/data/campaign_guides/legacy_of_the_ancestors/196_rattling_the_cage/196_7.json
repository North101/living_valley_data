The ground shakes as you grope in the dark for something to hold on to. The chamber rumbles again, and you hear the sound of falling rock echoing up from below. As you nearly lose your balance, you feel a sudden and urgent need to escape. If you can reach an area above the arcology's lowest substructure, you think you might be safe. You shudder to think of what might happen to you if you don't. </p></blockquote><p>Complete all Story and Interlude missions. Record <span color=\"blue\">UNKNOWN FATE</span> on the campaign tracker.

The ground leaps as you struggle to keep from falling over. You hear a terrible groaning all around you, and then as suddenly as they began, the tremors cease and all is silent.</p><p>You gather yourself and wonder as to the source of the quake. Perhaps you should check in with Silaro and ensure that the expedition is safe.</p></blockquote><p>Complete all Story and Interlude missions.</p><p>The lower levels of the arcology have completely collapsed.
