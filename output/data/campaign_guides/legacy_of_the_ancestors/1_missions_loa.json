  "content": "<p>To start the campaign, perform the first four steps of setup on page 10 of the rulebook, then return here for the remainder of setup.</p><blockquote><p>You wake with the dawn. The unmistakable aroma of Hy Pimpot\u2019s pancakes rouses you from your slumber. Birdsong drifts through the open window, and you raise your head to see the first rays of sunlight peek over Mount Nim. As a Ranger you\u2019ve grown accustomed to sleeping under the stars, but every once in awhile, it\u2019s nice to sleep in a comfortable bed, sheltered from the elements.</p></blockquote><p>Put the Lone Tree Station location into play in the surroundings.</p><blockquote><p>As you lie snug and warm, you recall a portion of the dream you had last night. You were in a dark cave, your surroundings barely illuminated. You remember the stillness of the air and the sound of a trickling stream. There was a being there with you, cloaked in shadow. As the light crawled slowly over its form, revealing it bit by bit, it turned its head toward you\u2014a head like a many-petaled flower, \u201cgrinning\u201d in a fashion that filled you with deep unease.</p><p>Your memory of the dream fades as you climb out of bed, and remember that you have an early meeting with Elder Thrush. You dress quickly and head straight to the kitchen for breakfast. You know from past experience that if you don\u2019t hurry, the pancakes will all be eaten and you\u2019ll have to settle for sunberry-mash and cream. </p><p>You pull on your tunic, step onto the balcony, and notice a darkened sky to the south. After several weeks of nearly perfect weather, heavily laden clouds have swept up from the Verdessa. It begins to rain. </p></blockquote><p>Put the Downpour weather into play.</p><blockquote><p>You weave your way through the covered stairways of Lone Tree Station, and as you reach Elder Thrush\u2019s ready room, your ears are filled with the rolling thrum of raindrops pelting the roof. </p><p>Elder Thrush stands at the far end of a circular table that dominates the center of the room. Carved from the trunk of a giga-redwood slain by lightning, the table bears faint scorch marks beneath a generous coat of lacquer.</p><p>In the center of the table sits a marvelous piece of technology: a multi-hued map of kinetic glass, large enough to depict the entire Valley. With a gesture from Elder Thrush, the surface of the Valley lifts, revealing partially mapped passageways in the ground below. </p><p>Spirit Speaker Nal and Ben Amon are there as well, speaking quietly to each other. As you enter they sit at attention. Elder Thrush studies the shimmering map for a moment, then gestures for you to take a seat across from her.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she says in a friendly, no-nonsense tone. \u201cI trust you slept well last night? I know that you were looking forward to some extended free time after your long patrol, but the people of the Valley are in need once again.\u201d You sit up a little straighter. \u201cDo you know Silaro Mako?\u201d</p><p>You tell Elder Thrush that you are familiar with the Valley\u2019s foremost archaeologist and enthusiast of Estian lore.</p><p>\u201cYou may not have felt it since you were patrolling the Northern Pass, but while you were gone, there was a tremor near Spire. It was barely perceptible here at the Station, and it did not last more than a few moments, but there are many who believe it was an event of great importance.</p><p>\"Silaro Mako is one of them. He believes that something has \u2026 shifted deep within the arcology ruin, and he\u2019s eager to investigate. A few days ago, he approached the Council of Elders with a proposal: He wants to lead an expedition into the depths of the arcology to discover the source of the tremor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElder,\u201d says Ben Amon, raising a finger. \u201cIf I may, Silaro\u2019s theory is well founded in historical fact. Long ago, when the Valley was first settled by our ancestors, there was a tremor not unlike this one. Our ancestors already knew of the arcology ruin beneath Spire, but after the tremor, Sal Orlin, Elder Orlin\u2019s father, discovered that a passage had opened near the surface.\"</p><p>Ben Amon gestures toward the map and the kinetic shards reform to show a detailed view of the Arcology Threshold. A passage within leads to a spiral staircase set inside a deep chimney\u2014a narrow, vertical chasm\u2014plunging far below the surface.</p><p>\"He went in not knowing what awaited him, and he returned with the Carbon Forge; the most valuable piece of technology we have today. I have no doubt that Silaro hopes to find that another doorway has opened somewhere in the ruin, and that beyond lies an equally important discovery.\u201d</p><p>Spirit Speaker Nal nods in agreement. \u201cThere may be another element to this as well. Shortly after the reclaimers came and went, I felt the arcology stir. It's agitated. It has the energy of a scroff-tousled anthill, like it's been startled awake after a centuries-long slumber. I've never been so aware of the lifeforms underground or of the arcology itself. This tremor is no coincidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is still much that we do not understand about the Estians,\u201d says Ben Amon. \u201cPerhaps the presence of the reclaimers caused an ancient failsafe to be triggered deep within the ruin, for there are many such cautionary tales concerning the relics of the ancestors and the dangers they pose to the unwary. It would be wise to temper our curiosity with caution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d says Elder Thrush. \u201cIt\u2019s been five years since the last expedition. Perhaps Calypsa spoke of it during your training. It was to be a simple excursion to Orlin\u2019s Vault, but tragedy must have befallen them, for none from the expedition were seen again.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cI recommended against this new expedition at the Council, but I found myself in the minority. I did agree, however, that it would be wise to send Rangers.</p><p>\"This is where you come in. You are to aid Silaro, and the rest of the expedition, in whatever way you can. And, of course, you are to see to it that everyone returns alive and unharmed.\u201d </p><p>She gestures, and with the crystalline tinkling of thousands of shards of glass, the glittering map of the Valley reforms, taking the shape of Spire. </p><p>\u201cThe easiest method by which you may descend into the arcology is by way of the Arcology Threshold in the village of Spire. However,\u201d she gestures again, and the map of the Valley returns, with certain areas marked by spinning golden flecks, \u201cthere are numerous sinkholes and other entrances to the arcology scattered throughout the Valley as well. The route you take is up to you.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Gain <b>THE DESCENT</b> mission.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cMay the Spirit of the Valley guide and protect you,\u201d she says. With that, Elder Thrush calls an end to the meeting and sends you on your way.</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Travel to the Chimney by way of either the Arcology Threshold (in Spire) or an Arcology Sinkhole (at non-pivotal locations) to meet up with Silaro Mako\u2019s expedition.</i></p><p>Complete setup by finishing steps 8, 9, and 10 on page 11 of the rulebook, using the Woods terrain set for step 8.</p><p color=\"blue\"><i>The path opens before you. Where you go from here is entirely up to you.</i></p>",
