When you turn the corner of the passageway, however, you do in fact find a miserable ball of fur huddling in the corner. When you get closer, you see that it's a lutrinal, with three distinctive stripes down its head. The poor being may have come from the surface, perhaps swept down by the floodwaters or possibly simply lost. Whatever the case, perhaps you can help it make its way back to its holt.</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear the Lost Lutrinal with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to gain its trust.</i></p>",
