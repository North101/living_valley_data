You smile to yourself and prepare to head out.</p></blockquote><p>Search the Lakeshore set for the Lutrinal Holt and put it into play.</p><blockquote><p>A trilling noise stops you, and you turn to see the lutrinal looking inquisitively in your direction. You take a few steps away, but after a moment, it bounds a couple steps closer. You shoo the little scamp back toward the water, but it seems it will not be deterred. Suddenly, it leaps upon you, and both you and the lutrinal tumble to the ground. It sits victoriously on your chest and licks your face with its rough tongue. Clearly, you\u2019ve made a friend for life. You decide that \"Stripe\" would be a perfect name.</p></blockquote><p>Gain the Stripe, Loyal Lutrinal reward card. Return <b>HELPING HAND</b> to the collection. Record <span class=\"text text_blue\">RETURNED TO THE HOLT</span> on the campaign tracker. Return Lost Lutrinal to the collection and permanently remove it from the Chimney set.</p>",
