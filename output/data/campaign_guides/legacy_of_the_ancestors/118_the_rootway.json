You gently hold a bloom in your hand, careful not to inadvertently pluck it, and discover that the flower has no odor.</p><p>You look around and see that there are flowers blooming throughout the passage, cheerfully dotting a dense forest of dark overgrowth.</p></blockquote><p>If you traveled here from The Cage, go to <a href=\"campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/158_locked_passage/158_2\"><entry>158.2</entry></a>.</p><p>Otherwise, go to <a href=\"campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/158_locked_passage/158_1\"><entry>158.1</entry></a>.</p>",
