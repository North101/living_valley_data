  "content": "<blockquote><p>The first thing you\u2019re struck by when you enter the chamber is the surprising presence of tangled branches, clumped vegetation, and other detritus deposited here from the surface. Judging by the high water mark and streaks of mud on the walls, the water here was at least three meters deep not long ago.</p><p>You surmise that the Silverfin, swollen as it was by Aell\u2019s flood, must have drained at least in part through the series of circular hatches in the ceiling of this chamber. Even though several of them are now choked with leaves, clumps of dirt, and uprooted trees, streams of water continue to flow lazily into the chamber from above. </p><p>It\u2019s then that you notice, tangled in the debris, the moldering corpses of several reclaimers being picked apart by small, eyeless, white-shelled crabs. Drawn by a morbid curiosity, you move closer, fascinated by the tiny, subterranean crustations. You\u2019ve heard tell of such beings from the Messipian, Ren Kobo, but have never seen one for yourself. Suddenly, you hear splashes and the sound of breaking branches behind you. You spin around to see a pair of reclaimers clambering over the tangled mass toward you! </p></blockquote><p>Search the general set for 2 Reclaimer Seekers and shuffle them into the path deck. </p><p>If you traveled here from Severed Artery, go to <a href=\"campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/156_flooded_passage/156_2\">156.2</a>.</p><p>Otherwise, go to <a href=\"campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/156_flooded_passage/156_1\">156.1</a>.</p>",
