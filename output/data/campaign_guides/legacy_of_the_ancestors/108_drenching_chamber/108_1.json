Judging by the high water mark and streaks of mud on the walls, the water here was at least three meters deep not long ago.</p><p>You surmise that the Silverfin, swollen as it was by Aell's flood, must have drained at least in part through the series of circular hatches in the ceiling of this chamber. Even though several of them are now choked with leaves, clumps of dirt, and uprooted trees, streams of water continue to flow lazily into the chamber from above. </p><p>It's then that you notice, tangled in the debris, the moldering corpses of several reclaimers being picked apart by small, eyeless, white-shelled crabs. Drawn by a morbid curiosity, you move closer, fascinated by the tiny, subterranean crustations. You've heard tell of such beings from the Messipian, Ren Kobo, but have never seen one for yourself. Suddenly, you hear splashes and the sound of breaking branches behind you. You spin around to see a pair of reclaimers clambering over the tangled mass toward you! </p></blockquote><p>Search the general set for 2 Reclaimer Seekers and shuffle them into the path deck. </p><p>If you traveled here from Severed Artery, go to <a href=\"campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/156_flooded_passage/156_2\"><entry>156.2</entry></a>.</p><p>Otherwise, go to <a href=\"campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/156_flooded_passage/156_1\"><entry>156.1</entry></a>.</p>",
