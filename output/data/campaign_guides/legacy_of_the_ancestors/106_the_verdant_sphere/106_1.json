Your interest piqued, you make your way to it and head inside.</p><p>Within, you find the interior space is largely dominated by a twisted knot of thick vines. Pushing aside as many as you can, you find they\u2019ve grown around an enclosure made entirely from a smooth, jade-green compound in the shape of a ribcage. With a shock, you realize this looks exactly like the enclosure for the arcology\u2019s heart\u00ad\u2014but in miniature. Could this be some kind of prototype? If so, it might provide valuable insight into how to treat the actual heart. To find out, you\u2019ll need to clear away a lot more of these vines.</p></blockquote><p>Gain the <b>OVERGROWN</b> mission. Search the general set for the Prototype and put it into play, (Contracted) side up. Add 3+<icon icon=\"per_ranger\">&nbsp;</icon> vines to the Prototype.</p>",
