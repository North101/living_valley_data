This expedition down into the old arcology is just another example.\u201d</p><p>Tykor paces back and forth, warming up to his topic. \u201cAs long as we insist on clinging to the relics of ancestors, we\u2019re never going to be able to live harmoniously with our surroundings. Those relics are always going to conjure forces like the reclaimers, tempting us to invent new technological solutions to solve the problem.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cMaybe next time something like the reclaimers shows up, we\u2019ll embrace the opportunity to break away from that cycle. This expedition into the arcology is just a fool\u2019s errand. The Estians were wiped out for a reason, and I can\u2019t think of any good that\u2019s going to come from disturbing their bones.\u201d</p><p>Tykor stops, breathing deeply. Then he looks at you as he gets himself under control. \u201cIf you plan on going down there, I sincerely hope that you'll be careful, lest you tempt a similar fate for us. Trust in nature. Trust your instincts. Be well.\u201d </p></blockquote><p>Discard the Fundamentalist.

It almost seems like he\u2019s nervous, or even feeling \u2026 guilty? </p><p>Tykor hems and haws for a bit, then looks at you. \u201cThe truth is \u2026 a little while back, I found a little mole. He was injured, and even though it was against my better judgment, well, I just couldn\u2019t help nursing him back to health. I even gave him a name: Gus.\u201d </p><p>He sighs. \u201cIt goes against everything I believe in to take an animal from its natural fate and care for it, but Gus was just so friendly and cute. And now \u2026\u201d he reaches into his pack and pulls out a small cage. Inside, a plump and obviously happy mole chirps and snuffles when he sees you. </p><p>You see Gus's adorable face reflected in the glass of Tykor's goggles. \u201cI can\u2019t return him to the wild now. That would just compound the mistake I made. Also, he seems to enjoy the companionship of people. Maybe \u2026 maybe you could take him instead? I think he\u2019d like the company.\u201d </p></blockquote><p>Gain the Gus the Mole reward card. Write <span color=\"blue\">MET THE MOLE</span> on your campaign tracker.</p>",
