This expedition down into the old arcology is just another example.\"</p><p>Tykor paces back and forth, warming up to his topic. \"As long as we insist on clinging to the relics of ancestors, we're never going to be able to live harmoniously with our surroundings. Those relics are always going to conjure forces like the reclaimers, tempting us to invent new technological solutions to solve the problem.\"</p><p>He shrugs. \"Maybe next time something like the reclaimers shows up, we'll embrace the opportunity to break away from that cycle. This expedition into the arcology is just a fool's errand. The Estians were wiped out for a reason, and I can't think of any good that's going to come from disturbing their bones.\"</p><p>Tykor stops, breathing deeply. Then he looks at you as he gets himself under control. \"If you plan on going down there, I sincerely hope that you'll be careful, lest you tempt a similar fate for us. Trust in nature. Trust your instincts. Be well.\" </p></blockquote><p>Discard the Fundamentalist.

He was injured, and even though it was against my better judgment, well, I just couldn't help nursing him back to health. I even gave him a name: Gus.\" </p><p>He sighs. \"It goes against everything I believe in to take an animal from its natural fate and care for it, but Gus was just so friendly and cute.

That would just compound the mistake I made. Also, he seems to enjoy the companionship of people. Maybe \u2026 maybe you could take him instead?
