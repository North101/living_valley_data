You step back from the main path, and soon you see the distinctive figure of Tykor Hum, the so-called \u201cFundamentalist\u201d of the Valley. He pauses often to study plants growing along the trail, and occasionally he flicks his hand across a flower, gathers a dusting of pollen, then reaches back to rub one of the flowers peeking from his pack. </p><p>When Tykor straightens up, stretching and cracking his back, he catches sight of you. He tips his broad-brimmed hat in greeting. </p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear the Fundamentalist with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to ask him how he's been.</i></p>",
