  "content": "<blockquote id=\"narration_1\"><p>As you move through the arteries, you come across gusts of warm, moist air rising up from shafts you spot beneath them. When you eventually find a stairway running down one, you begin to check it out.</p><p>The further you go into the shafts, the warmer and wetter the air grows. However, when you touch the walls, they feel dry. Soon the stairwell opens into a labyrinthine network of dark, cramped passages, run through with pipes, wires, conduits, and ducts. You can\u2019t be sure, but they all seem to be meandering downwards, leading to some deep heart of the arcology.</p></blockquote>",
