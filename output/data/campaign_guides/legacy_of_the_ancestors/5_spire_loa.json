  "content": "<blockquote><p>Rising out of an island in the middle of the Silverfin, the first thing you spot is the landmark that gives the town its name. A massive gray spire at the center of the island towers over the cottages, workshops, and trade halls that make up the rest of the town. As impressive as it is, you know that it is but a protrusion of the ancient arcology that extends deep into the roots of the Valley. The entrance to that arcology lies beyond the Arcology Threshold.</p></blockquote><p><b>If <span color=\"blue\">SPIRE FALLEN</span>, continue reading:</b></p><blockquote><p>Now, however, the spire is surrounded by scaffolding, cranes, and a few plumes of smoke from ferro-kilns and glassblowers. Hoversleds laden with stone and carbonforged beams hang in the air as artisans and willing citizens work side-by-side to repair the rooftops and walls. In just two months, much of the damage from the reclaimer attack has already been repaired.</p></blockquote>",
