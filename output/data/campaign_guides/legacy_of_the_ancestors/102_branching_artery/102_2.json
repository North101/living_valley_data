After a few minutes, your heartbeat slows, and the sweat begins drying on your skin. Then you hear footsteps, and a minute later, Kal Iver jogs into view. When he sees you, his eyes widen in surprise, then he shakes his head ruefully. </p><p>\"I'll be planted! You beat me again!\" he says, shaking his head. \"Whenever you're ready for a rematch, you know where to find me.\" Kal gives you a playful salute, and continues on his way. </p></blockquote><p>Each Ranger soothes 2 fatigue.
