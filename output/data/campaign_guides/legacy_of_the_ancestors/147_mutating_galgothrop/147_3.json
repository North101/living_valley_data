Two of the most important are that galgothrops prefer only the deepest shadows, and while carnivorous, they are opportunists, not hunters. They lurk complacently in dark passages or beneath unstable piles of rubble, hoping for an easy meal. </p></blockquote><p>Record <span color=\"blue\">COMPREHENDED THE GALGOTHROP</span> on the campaign tracker.
