Unfortunately, the reliability of 2 free progress on a being every round made Oru too favorable when compared to riskier or costlier options that keep the game interesting, and also forces us to design other connection options with the strength of this card in mind. For this version, we've decided to simply lower the amount of progress Oru places to 1. He's still a very good boy.</i></p>",
