  "content": "<p><i>Revised text is <code>highlighted</code>.</i></p><p>This card's ability now reads as follows:</p><blockquote id=\"narration_1\"><p><code>Attach to the location. Use 1 alarm: Before a challenge effect on a being would resolve, cancel that effect.</code></p></blockquote><p><img src=\"https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/assets/images/Rebalanced_Ranger_Cards_eng11-9bba086a61df3d274361f3779323f682.png#errata_cards\" /></p><p><i>Elder's notes: All right, we'll be honest here. Instead of a gentle nudge in the right direction, what we've done to this card is effectively latch it to the Swift and send it somewhere else entirely. Rather than decrease the cost of the sentinel to match its effect, we've decided to alter the sentinel by having it attach to the location, rather than a specific being.</i></p>",
