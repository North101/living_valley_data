We wanted to preserve both of these effects while limiting the sheer amount of value Rangers can get out of it. Now, Rangers have to decide whether they want to use Pokodo to generate tokens on aid cards, or to generate progress. This also means Rangers who don't focus on aid cards can still use Pokodo to great effect without feeling like they're losing something in the exchange.</i></p>",
