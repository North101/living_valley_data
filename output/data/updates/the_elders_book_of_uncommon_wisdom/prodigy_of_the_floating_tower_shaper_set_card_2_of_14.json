  "content": "<p><i>Revised text is <code>highlighted</code>.</i></p><p>Add <code>Discard a card from your hand to...\"</code> before the rest of the role's effect.</p><p><img src=\"https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/assets/images/Rebalanced_Ranger_Cards_eng13-345b39364167380f67ae683150f92086.png#errata_cards\" /></p><p><i>Elder's notes: This role's power fantasy is recurring a powerful manifestation from the discard to use it over and over again, the limiting factor being the number of tokens on your conduit. This new version forces you to swap out a card in your hand for the card you wish to retrieve. So long as you have other cards to sacrifice, you can still partake in this card's power fantasy by reusing the same manifestation round after round, but it's no longer a no-brainer to simply grab a manifestation from your discard every time you need icons to commit.</i></p>",
