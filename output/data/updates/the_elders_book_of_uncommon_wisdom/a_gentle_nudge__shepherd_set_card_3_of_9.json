  "content": "<p><i>Revised text is <code>highlighted</code>.</i></p><p>This card's ability now reads:</p><blockquote><p>`One at a time, each Ranger may move a being that is within reach of them. Add 1<span><icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon></span> to each being moved in this way.</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/assets/images/Rebalanced_Ranger_Cards_eng4-138101ccbccd0e25f7f85ea636ceff8e.png#errata_cards\"></p><p><i>Elder's notes: For this version of this card, we've flipped it on its head; now instead of having to discard 1 progress from each being you want to move, you add 1 progress to them! It's worded in such a way as to prevent players from sending the same being back and forth in order to stack multiple progress on it. This version should also find some fun synergy with some of the new Spirit Speaker cards coming in Stewards of the Valley!</i></p>",
