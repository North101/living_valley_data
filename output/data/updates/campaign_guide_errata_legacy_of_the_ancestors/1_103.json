The wide terrace of the marketplace is bustling with activity, and you see folk from every corner of the Valley chattering excitedly with one another. It appears as though Ren Kobo's semi-annual swap meet is well underway. Amid the din you can pick out elevated moments of some ferociously good-natured haggling.</p></blockquote><p><b>If you\u2019ve completed THE VALLEY\u2019S SECRETS mission, go to <a href=\"#1103a\">1.103a</a>. Otherwise, continue reading: </b></p><blockquote id=\"narration_2\"><p>As you make your way to the terrace, you\u2019re greeted by a throng of friendly faces. Some want to give you a small token by way of thanking you for your service to the Valley. Others are simply excited to see that a Ranger has come to the swap meet (who just might have something interesting to trade)! </p></blockquote><p><code>Gain the LIMITED TIME OFFER mission if you don't already have it.

You turn and see the venerable Messipian merchant Ren Kobo. He beckons you to a quiet alcove, sheltered from the elements. He eyes the gear hanging from your pack and chuckles appreciatively.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been doing well for yourself,\u201d he says. \u201cSome very nice pieces, I must say! But perhaps you\u2019d be willing to trade something for this?\u201d </p><p>He steps deeper into the alcove and returns with a truly impressive piece of headgear. \u201cThis beauty has been sitting unused in my storehouse for far too many seasons.\u201d</p><p>You notice that the hat is nearly identical to Ren Kobo\u2019s own. \u201cI liked it so much that I acquired a spare,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve never worn it except to try it on.\u201d He looks at the spare hat with great admiration. \u201cPerhaps this one would see use with you? It\u2019s a symbol of great distinction among the most accomplished sailors in the flotilla, and it keeps off the sun and rain to boot!\u201d </p></blockquote><p>You can trade all of your copies of a single unlocked reward for Ren Kobo\u2019s Hat. This exchange is permanent. If you do, gain the Ren Kobo\u2019s Hat reward card, and cross out the old reward on your campaign tracker.</p><p><code>Gain the LIMITED TIME OFFER mission if you don't already have it.
