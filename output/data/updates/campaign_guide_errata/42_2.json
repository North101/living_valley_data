Revised text is <code>highlighted</code>.</i></p><blockquote><p>You climb aboard as Ben Amon himself emerges from the hangar and hops into the pilot's seat. \"Strap in!\" he says, lowering a pair of goggles over his eyes. \"I heard that you made quite the case to the crew. Honestly, though,\" he says with a smile, \"I never need much of an excuse to take the Swift out for a walk. There's nothing in this world like flying. You'll see!\" With that, Ben Amon flips a series of switches and you feel the Swift come to life.</p></blockquote><p>You may immediately <code>proceed to the travel phase of the round. If you do, you can travel to any location within 3 paths (even if there are ready cards with the obstacle keyword in play).</code> Use the terrain type of the last path you crossed over. If you choose to travel in this way, discard the current challenge card, and do not resolve the remainder of this test.</p><p>If you choose not to travel, discard Topside Mast, and resolve the remainder of the test as normal.</p>",
