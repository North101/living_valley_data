I like trees, but I\u2019m used to looking down on them from high up.\u201d</p><code>Discard all <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> from Tala.</code></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>Meadow:</b> You don\u2019t spend too long in Meadow before you can tell Tala isn\u2019t happy here. \u201cThe Ice Clans live on top of mountains. It\u2019s so flat here. Is there anywhere in the Valley that\u2019s rocky and high up?\u201d</p><code>Discard all <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> from Tala.</code></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>Spire:</b> You take Tala around Spire, from the taverns and streets to the tops of the highest balconies in the shadow of the Spire. She looks happy on the balconies, but as soon as you suggest going back into town, she flinches. \u201cI like the heights, but you have way too many people here!\u201d</p><code>Discard all <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> from Tala.</code></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>Tumbledown:</b> You lead Tala to the edge of Tumbledown, overlooking the falls. Suddenly she whoops with excitement, a shout that almost startles you out of your boots. \u201cLook at this place!\u201d she shouts. \u201cIt\u2019s just like the cliffs and mountains at home, even if it is a bit warm! Let\u2019s go, I want to meet the kinds of people who like to live here.\u201d You head down to the village, but you\u2019re already sure that you\u2019ve found Tala\u2019s new home.</p><p><code>Gain the Tala\u2019s Perseverance reward card. Discard Tala, and return HELPING HAND to the collection. Permanently move Tala to the Tumbledown set. Record FOUND TALA A HOME on the campaign tracker.</code></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>White Sky:</b> You take Tala around White Sky. She spends a long time sitting on the edge of one of the platforms, staring across the lake. But then she gets up and shakes her head. \u201cI like the water, but it\u2019s too calm. Too peaceful here. I want to live somewhere with some excitement, where you really get to see the fury of nature.\u201d</p><code>Discard all <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> from Tala.</code></blockquote>",
