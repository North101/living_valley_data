It's so flat here.

She looks happy on the balconies, but as soon as you suggest going back into town, she flinches. \"I like the heights, but you have way too many people here!\"</p><code>Discard all <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> from Tala.</code></blockquote><blockquote id=\"narration_4\"><p><b>Tumbledown:</b> You lead Tala to the edge of Tumbledown, overlooking the falls. Suddenly she whoops with excitement, a shout that almost startles you out of your boots. \"Look at this place!\" she shouts. \"It's just like the cliffs and mountains at home, even if it is a bit warm! Let's go, I want to meet the kinds of people who like to live here.\" You head down to the village, but you're already sure that you've found Tala's new home.</p><p><code>Gain the <reward>Tala's Perseverance</reward> reward card.

She spends a long time sitting on the edge of one of the platforms, staring across the lake. But then she gets up and shakes her head. \"I like the water, but it's too calm. Too peaceful here. I want to live somewhere with some excitement, where you really get to see the fury of nature.\"</p><code>Discard all <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> from Tala.</code></blockquote>",
