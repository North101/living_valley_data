Then, if both are complete, read the following:</p><blockquote><p>The lure amplifiers are set. Now you need to meet Kasende in the Marsh of Rebirth and activate the lure itself.</p></blockquote><p><code>Complete the WORM FOOD mission</code> and gain the <b>JOURNEY (MARSH OF REBIRTH)</b> mission. If you are on <b>LOST BROTHER</b>, complete that mission as you settle on this approach to resolving the reclaimer threat.</p>",
