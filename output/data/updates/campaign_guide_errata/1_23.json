A torrent of water over five meters high erupts into the reclaimer nest and carries the grubs, polyps, and seekers away in a churning froth. For several minutes, you watch as hundreds of reclaimers struggle against the rushing water, being carried down the river. Eventually, the skies begin to clear, and the flood begins to subside.</p><p>You head over to Aell, who is leaning on his conduit. You can see he\u2019s exhausted, and portions of the conduit have burned out, leaving black scorch marks. He smiles at you, a warm and genuine expression of profound satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cWe did it,\u201d he sighs. \"We really did it!\u201d Tears fill his eyes, and he tries unsuccessfully to wipe them away.</p></blockquote><p>Complete the <b>WASHED AWAY</b> and <b>INVASION</b> missions. Write <span class=\"text text_blue\">RECLAIMERS WASHED AWAY</span> and <span class=\"text text_blue\">AELL REDEEMED</span> on the campaign tracker. Each Ranger soothes 2 fatigue.</p><blockquote><p>A few hours later, the Swift comes gliding in over the trees, carrying a full complement of Rangers. You reach the bank of the Silverfin just as it lands, and Kal Iver emerges from the hatch.</p><p>\"Well done!\" he says. \"I've never been happier to lose a bet to Calypsa.\" He laughs and claps you on the back. \"Well done indeed!\"</p><p>After some discussion, you decide that Kal should take Aell, who is clearly drained and exhausted, to Spire aboard the Swift. There he can rest and be with his sister, Dace. You\u2019ll head to Lone Tree Station where Elder Thrush will want a full report.</p></blockquote><p>If Aell, Ambitious Shaper is in play, return him to the collection. Gain the <b>JOURNEY (LONE TREE STATION)</b> mission. <code>Complete the Remove the Reclaimers mission. Return all reclaimers in play to the General set. Return all Flood cards to the General set.</code></p>",
