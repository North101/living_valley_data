There are reclaimers everywhere!\"</p></blockquote><blockquote id=\"narration_3\"><p>Aell leads you to the edge of the tower, and you look down into a vast pit teeming with reclaimers consuming the heart of the ruins. \"This is going to be dangerous,\" Aell says, and you agree. \"Do you want to rest before we begin?

He carefully unwraps what appears to be a long wooden cylinder, woven through with delicate copper wire. He picks it up, and it makes a hissing sound like a far-off deluge.

It may take hours for the flooding to begin. Once it does, you're going to need to direct the flow of water for maximum effect. Otherwise, this whole place may be washed away, or we may not hit the nest at all!\"</p><p>Aell adjusts his hat and flashes a confident smile. \"Just let me know if you need assistance. And keep those reclaimers off of me!\" With that, he raises his conduit, and the skies instantly darken.</p></blockquote><p color=\"blue\"><i>Clear Aell with <icon icon=\"progress\">&nbsp;</icon> to move a Flood card.</i></p><p>Complete the <mission>JOURNEY (ALLUVIAL RUINS)</mission> mission, and gain the <mission>WASHED AWAY</mission> mission.
