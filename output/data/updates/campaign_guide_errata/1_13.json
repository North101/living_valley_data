Zek recognizes you from Ranger training, and both he and Sirisana listen in mounting alarm to your experiences with the reclaimers.</p></blockquote><p><code><span color=\"red\">If you are currently on Watcher in the Brush, Trail of Vines, or Deeper Motives:</span> Go to 1.13a. <span color=\"red\">Otherwise:</span> go to 1.13b.</code></p><h1 id=\"113a\">1.13A</h1><blockquote id=\"narration_2\"><p>You mention the mysterious Verdessian that's been lurking about. Sirisana\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cA Verdessian, you say? I have heard about these beings, but I have never seen one myself. Perhaps it would be worthwhile for you to find this being and attempt to communicate with it. It may be able to offer some insight\u2014if it's able to communicate in the first place, of course.\u201d</p></blockquote><choice id=\"rangers-choose\">RANGERS CHOOSE</choice><p color=\"red\">A) Return to the outpost after speaking with the Verdessian.</p><blockquote id=\"narration_3\"><p>You agree with Sirisana, telling her you\u2019ll attempt to track down the Verdessian and speak with it, then return to the outpost.</p></blockquote><p>Keep the <b>JOURNEY (BIOLOGICAL OUTPOST)</b> mission.</p><p color=\"red\">B) Forget the Verdessian.
