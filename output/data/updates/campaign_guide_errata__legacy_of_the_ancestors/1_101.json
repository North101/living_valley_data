Otherwise, if you don't have the <b>SEARCH BELOW (SILARO MAKO)</b> mission, read the following:</p><blockquote><p>At the base of a massive cylinder of forged carbon, you see several lambance rigs illuminating the space in a wide ring. Within, there are the beginnings of a base camp. The advance team moves about the space, taking stock, unpacking crates, setting up equipment, and building temporary structures. Beyond, there is a vast darkness, sparkling with a strange kind of precipitation that illuminates the boundaries of the cavern as it falls. Shadows move and shift as the droplets pass. The effect is mesmerizing.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d A confident voice cuts through the still air. You turn to see a tall, bearded man with impeccable posture walking toward you. \u201cWe\u2019ve been calling it glitterain. Not sure what it is, but it sure is fascinating! I\u2019m Harlan. Harlan Vos,\u201d he says, extending his hand in greeting. \u201cYou must be the additional Rangers Elder Thrush promised us.\u201d</p><p>You introduce yourself and inquire as to Silaro Mako\u2019s whereabouts.</p><p>\u201cSilaro went on ahead some time ago,\u201d explains Harlan. \u201cHe got so excited when he arrived that he just had to venture deeper. I\u2019ve never been one to stand in the way of an explorer, so I didn\u2019t protest, but it\u2019s been at least a day since he left. Maybe I should have tried to convince him otherwise.\u201d</p><p>You are about to respond when you feel a familiar tug on your backpack.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d You look down to see the cheerful face of Quisi Vos looking up at you. Is she \u2026 eating your trail mix? \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. That other Ranger\u2019s not nearly as fun as you are. What was his name again, dad?\u201d </p><p>\u201cKal Iver,\u201d says Harlan. \u201cHe arrived a few hours before you did. Said that we should expect you to be right behind him \u2018as usual.\u2019 He went on ahead, but he didn\u2019t seem too worried about Silaro. Can you keep an eye out for him? Silaro is supposed to be leading this expedition, after all. He should probably be here.\u201d</p></blockquote><choice id=\"rangers-choose\">RANGERS CHOOSE</choice><p color=\"red\">A) Of course!

It looks like a small village, bustling with activity. Among the gathered crew, you spot the young rapscallion Quisi Vos talking excitedly with her father, Harlan, and your old rival, Kal Iver. </p><p>Kal lies back on a hammock suspended several feet above the ground by two memlev devices, one at the head of the hammock and one at its foot. As you approach, he hops off with a grunt of effort and steps toward Silaro Mako, giving you a laconic salute. \u201cYou\u2019re in good hands, Silaro,\u201d he says. \u201cElder Thrush has sent us the absolute best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she did!\u201d says Silaro. \u201cAll the Elders know how important this expedition is. They\u2019ll also be happy to know that my theory was correct! New passages have opened up in the arcology! The last time anyone was down here, there was only one passage leading from this chamber. Now there are many more. I\u2019d be willing to bet there are even more beyond those!\u201d With hardly a pause, Silaro turns to you and says: \u201cWhat I need you to do is a bit of scouting. First, investigate the immediate vicinity, then we\u2019ll see about venturing deeper.\u201d</p><p>He rummages in a nearby crate and withdraws a handheld device. \u201cTake this lambance rig with you. Illumination is in short supply down here, and you don\u2019t want to go fumbling around in the dark\u2014not where you\u2019re going!\u201d He claps you on the back. \u201cDrink it in, my friend. Wherever you go, you could very well be the first human to set foot there in over a thousand years!\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Complete <b>THE DESCENT</b> mission. Gain the <b>SURVEY THE DEPTHS</b> mission and the Lambance Rig reward card.</p><blockquote><p>You note that Silaro is truly in his element. If he were any more excited, he may very well float back up to the surface. \u201cWhile you\u2019re away, I plan on doing some \u2018scouting\u2019 of my own,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve discovered some Estian script that may very well be instructions for how to operate the arcology itself! I just need time to translate it. Perhaps by the time you return, I\u2019ll know more.\u201d </p></blockquote><p>Record <span color=\"blue\">CHIMNEY IS SETTLED</span> on the campaign tracker. Then, if <span color=\"blue\">199.4</span> isn't on your day tracker, record <span color=\"blue\">199.4</span> 7 days from now on the day tracker.</p><blockquote><p>As Silaro departs, Kal pulls you aside. He speaks to you in an uncharacteristically low and serious tone. \u201cBetween us, I\u2019m not too keen on being down here,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve done some scouting, and I rate the stability of this structure as tenuous at best. Tread lightly.\u201d </p></blockquote><p>If <span color=\"blue\">SPIRE FALLEN </span>, continue reading:</p><blockquote><p>As you prepare to leave base camp, you take note of the damage done to the Estian ruins by the passage of the reclaimers: claw marks, shredded wall paneling, and the distinctive, all-too-familiar half-melted look indicating the presence of grubs.</p><p>Even as you shudder at the memory, you realize that something\u2019s not quite right. Where are the reclaimers themselves? The place should be swarming with them, shouldn\u2019t it? What could have happened to them all?</p><p>You draw your cloak a little more tightly as you proceed.</p></blockquote>",
