You just finished meeting with all of the Elders of the Valley. A gathering like this is rare, but so is the problem they came to discuss. One of the species of biomeld in the Valley, the caustic mulcher, has become more prominent and is beginning to spread southward.
The Elders are worried, and so are you, for caustic mulchers are known to indiscriminately digest any living being that crosses their path. Deep in the wild forests of the Valley they are regarded by some as a critical part of the ecosystem, but this close to the inhabitants of the Valley, they could be more harmful than helpful. Recently, one particular mulcher has been seen roaming the shores of the Silverfin near Spire, and your neighbors worry that it’s only a matter of time before it ensnares an unwary villager with its barbed tongue.
The Council of Elders agreed that something needs to be done, but they left it up to you to decide how to deal with the problem. But before you make that decision, you’ll have to find the mulcher."
one_day_missions.predatory_instincts.narration_2,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/one_day_missions/predatory_instincts,"Elder Orlin escorts you to the bridge leading from Spire to the shore, turns, and gives you a serious nod.
“This isn’t going to be an easy task, but after Commander Thrush spoke so highly of you and that other young Ranger, Kal Iver, I’m sure at least one of you will be able to complete this mission.” She points to the line of trees on the far shore. “The mulcher has been spotted along the Silverfin from here to White Sky, but gets around surprisingly quickly. I imagine you will have success luring it no matter where you look, so take whatever path feels right to you."
one_day_missions.predatory_instincts.1_42.narration_1,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/one_day_missions/predatory_instincts/1_42,"You hide in a small stand of trees, waiting for the mulcher to appear. Your bait sits, untouched. You’re beginning to think that you headed in the wrong direction when, suddenly, one of the trees next to you moves.
The biomeld is enormous. What you thought was a tree is just one of its towering legs. With an alien grace, it strides towards the bait."
one_day_missions.predatory_instincts.1_42.narration_2,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/one_day_missions/predatory_instincts/1_42#rangers-choose,"Now you have a choice: how to deal with this being. You can attempt to kill the mulcher, removing the threat to your neighbors once and for all, or you can try to come to some sort of understanding with it. Perhaps you can find a way to prevent the caustic mulcher -- and others of its kind -- from unwittingly harming the people of the Valley."
one_day_missions.predatory_instincts.1_43_confront.narration_1,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/one_day_missions/predatory_instincts/1_43-confront_progress,"The caustic mulcher’s tongue whips towards you, but you leap out of the way at the last moment. With precise timing, you grab onto one of the mulcher’s legs and scramble up onto its back.
Now, perched above its lashing tongue and snapping maw, you reach the loose folds of skin at the base of its thorax. You grab hold and squeeze, and after a long moment, the mulcher grows still, and it lowers its body to the ground.
You were right to trust your instincts. The caustic mulcher seems to respond favorably to firm pressure on whatever part of its anatomy lies underneath the fleshy mass currently clutched in your arms. You begin a careful process of trial and error, massaging around the ""thorax"" until the mulcher begins to emit a horrific gurgling sound. Emitted from any other being, you'd assume the sound indicated an upset stomach or some other ailment, but coming from the mulcher, you're  certain its a sound akin to the joyous purring of a lutrinal. Perhaps with enough time and patience, you may just be able to tame it, but for now, you feel like you can at least lead it away from Spire and into the heart of the forest."
one_day_missions.predatory_instincts.1_44_confront.narration_1,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/one_day_missions/predatory_instincts/1_44-confront_harm,"With a frightening, grating wail, the spindle-legged caustic mulcher collapses to the ground with a heavy thud. You watch as the flesh of its belly suddenly swells. The mulcher releases a final, foul smelling cloud of gas, deflates, and grows still.
Once you are certain it's dead, you approach the mulcher and place your hand upon it. You recall the words of the Spirit Speaker of your village, taught to every hunter, angler, and shepherd from a young age. ""May the spirit of this being find its way unhindered to the source, and may those of us who remain on Earth give thanks for the lifeforce that yet flows within us. Until we meet again...""
You turn and walk down the path. The Elders will want to know that the mulcher is no more."

You lean against a rock, heaving a deep sigh. You can’t hunt the mulcher in this state, so you loosen your boots and make yourself comfortable. Just as you begin to settle in for a rest, you hear the crash of lumbering footsteps. You leap to your feet and prepare for the worst.
A caustic mulcher bursts through the trees and charges toward you. You brace for impact, but suddenly the mulcher stops short just a few meters away. Its tongue hangs limply beneath it, and it makes no move to grab you.
“Hallo there!” You look up to see a figure atop the mulcher: Kal Iver, a Ranger well known as one of the most capable (and confident) in the Valley. “Looks like you could use a ride. Turns out these things are pretty easy to tame if you know what you’re doing!”
You hesitantly accept, and careful climb onto the mulcher's back. Although you need to endure Kal’s boasting all the way to the Ranger Station, you have to admit, there's nothing quite like riding a mulcher when your legs are tired."
one_day_missions.predatory_instincts.end_of_the_day.narration_2,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/one_day_missions/predatory_instincts/end_the_day#resolve-the-following-based-on-how-you-ended-the-day,"You wince as you walk forward. Blood is soaking through your temporary bandages. You lean down against a rock, stifling a moan. You’ve tried your best, but you wouldn’t be able to hunt the mulcher in this state.
You set up camp for the night and begin to rewrap your bandages when you hear someone approaching along the trail. You look up to see Kal Iver, a Ranger well known as one of the most capable (and confident) in the Valley, stagger up the path while dragging the massive tentacle-tongue of a caustic mulcher.
“Why hello!” He throws down the tongue and joins you, stripping off thick, acid-scarred gloves as he does. “Take a look at what I’m bringing to Sirisana at the Biological Outpost! I bet you’re glad you weren’t the only one the Elders assigned to this mission. Hope you don’t mind if I stay here for the night; wrestling with that mulcher really tired me out! Though, I'd say I have less to complain about than it does, poor fellow.”
Kal kicks off his boots, tips his hat over his eyes, and begins snoring softly. You go back to tending your wounds, not the least of which your bruised ego."

You send up a starspark, signaling for any Ranger in the vicinity to come to your aid. It soars high above the trees and explodes in a shower of glittering white light. You assure your companion that help is on the way."
one_day_missions.predatory_instincts.end_of_the_day.narration_4,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/one_day_missions/predatory_instincts/end_the_day#resolve-the-following-based-on-how-you-ended-the-day-1,"You stagger back, tumble, and take cover behind a fallen tree. You’ve pushed yourself to your limits, but the mulcher is just too formidable a foe. The struggle has left you exhausted, and if you keep going, you might end up the mulcher’s next meal. You take your first opening and flee. You will have to get some rest, regroup, and try again tomorrow."
one_day_missions.predatory_instincts.end_of_the_day.narration_5,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/one_day_missions/predatory_instincts/end_the_day#resolve-the-following-based-on-how-you-ended-the-day-1,"Despite your greatest efforts, the mulcher has proven to be too formidable a foe. You think back upon your life and all the events that led you here to this moment. Despite the direness of your current dilemma, you find that you have no regrets. You embrace the end as the mulcher envelopes you in its grotesque mouth. But then, the mulcher's jaws unclench, rain pours in, and you see a cloaked figure framed against the darkened sky, a foot on either side of the mulcher's mouth, holding it open.
""Don't just sit there!"" he yells. ""Get out while you can!""
As if freed from a trance, you find the strength to leap from the mulcher's grasp and run to safety. After some time, you hear the mulcher move off in into the distance, and you're joined by your savior, a fellow Ranger by the name of Kal Iver. He looks you over, making sure you're not bleeding, and that nothing is broken. Once satisfied with your well-being, he sits down beside you and takes a drink from his infusion canteen.
""Thank the ancestors I came along when I did!"" he says. ""A few more minutes and you would have been nothing more than a slurry of your component elements!""
You give Kal your thanks and think back on your close shave with death. You take a deep, invigorating breath. You are alive, and all the more thankful for it."

Realizing the horrible danger, you leap up and wrestle your companion free. You both land hard on the ground. The mulcher reels, and you use the opportunity to flee. You run until your legs can carry you no further. Taking shelter at the base of a tall and sturdy oak, you listen for sounds of pursuit. There are none. You and your companion are safe. 
Looking at your their wounds, they are going to need more help than you can provide. Once you're certain that the mulcher has lost interest, you send up a starspark, signaling for any Ranger in the vicinity to come to your aid. It soars high above the trees and explodes in a shower of glittering white light. You assure your companion that help is on the way."
