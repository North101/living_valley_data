one_day_missions.animal_rescue.narration_1,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/one_day_missions/animal_rescue,"On this chill, cloudy day, birds chirp overhead and cicadas buzz in the distance. Dark storm clouds loom on the horizon, soon approaching. You are patrolling the Valley, on alert for anything out of the ordinary. Just as you are beginning to suspect nothing eventful will occur today, you spot an injured animal on the side of the trail, whimpering and crying for help."
one_day_missions.animal_rescue.narration_2,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/one_day_missions/animal_rescue#based-on-which-challenge-symbol-was-drawn,"A sitka doe limps painfully by the side of the trail. You check the fawn's legs for injuries, but they seem uninjured. You wonder if its hoof is cracked or wounded in some way. Calming it down enough to lift its leg, you examine the hoof. Indeed, the hoof has cracked and a piece has torn off, likely during a scuffle or chase through the rough woodlands. This doe definitely won’t survive on its own—even a lone wolhund would pounce on such easy prey without hesitation. With no other pressing tasks on hand, you take it upon yourself to try to help this young doe. If you can bring her to the Biological Outpost, maybe Sirisana Mir or one of the other researchers there can repair the cracked hoof and restore her to health."
one_day_missions.animal_rescue.narration_3,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/one_day_missions/animal_rescue#based-on-which-challenge-symbol-was-drawn,"A young lutrinal lies by the side of the lake, abandoned. You lean over and examine the Lutrinal’s leg. It’s bent out of shape, the bone cracked internally. Thankfully it hasn’t broken the skin, but you know this poor guy isn’t going to last without help. The fracture is far too severe to heal on its own. At the very best, he’ll be left behind by the rest of his romp. At worst, he’ll succumb to pain or get caught by a hungry Naiad. With no other pressing tasks on hand, you take it upon yourself to try to help this young lutrinal. If you can bring him to the Biological Outpost, maybe Sirisana Mir or one of the other researchers there can repair the broken limb and restore him to health."
one_day_missions.animal_rescue.narration_4,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/one_day_missions/animal_rescue#based-on-which-challenge-symbol-was-drawn,"A marmot lies on the side of the trail, its coat is caked with blood. It shivers, terrified, as you approach. You step forward carefully and gain its trust, then examine the wound along its back. A few bite marks confirm your suspicions. This poor little guy must have gotten into a scuffle with a hydraworm and barely escaped with its life. Without medical attention, it will surely die of its wounds. With no other pressing tasks on hand, you take it upon yourself to try to help this young marmot. If you can bring him to the Biological Outpost, maybe Sirisana Mir or one of the other researchers there can administer first aid and restore him to health."
one_day_missions.animal_rescue.narration_5,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/one_day_missions/animal_rescue#based-on-which-challenge-symbol-was-drawn,You carefully scoop the wounded animal into your arms and begin the long journey to the Biological Outpost. You’ll have to protect the injured animal from predators and make sure to continue to care for its wounds so its condition doesn’t worsen.
one_day_missions.animal_rescue.ar1.narration_1,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/one_day_missions/animal_rescue/ar1,"You burst through the doors of the outpost and call for Sirisana, who comes barging in moments later. “What’s wrong?” She then notices the animal cradled in your arms and motions for you to follow her. She clears space off of one of the counters in her lab and together, very carefully, you lay the animal down on its side. “We don’t usually do rehabilitation like this, but since you came all this way, there’s no way I’m releasing it into the wild in this condition. Please wash your hands and come with me—I’ll need your assistance.”"
one_day_missions.animal_rescue.ar2.narration_1,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/one_day_missions/animal_rescue/ar2,"Sirisana administers a tranquilizer to the fawn, putting her to sleep. Then together, you get to work repairing the cracked hoof: first, drilling horizontal holes through the hoof and lacing carbon wire through the cracks, then stabilizing it with a thick paste-like substance. Finally, she brings the sleeping fawn to an empty cage and places her gently on the cushioned bed inside.  “I’ll keep an eye on her as she recovers. She should make a full recovery. We’ll have to keep her here until she’s grown a little more, but we should be able to release her back into the wild after that.” She gives you a warm smile and shakes your hand. “You’ve done her a great service today. I don’t doubt she’ll never forget what you’ve done for her.”"

Then you help her create a makeshift splint for the lutrinal’s leg, and she brings the sleeping lutrinal to an empty cage, placing him gently on the cushioned bed inside. “I’ll keep an eye on the little guy as he recovers. I won’t be able to release him until his leg is fully healed, but he should make a full recovery. Then we’ll bring him to his natural habitat and let him back into the wild. Don’t worry, lutrinals are very social animals—he’ll join a new romp soon enough and be back to his usual curious self.” She gives you a warm smile and shakes your hand. “You’ve done him a great service today. I don’t doubt he’ll never forget what you’ve done for him.”"

Then together, you get to work stitching the wound closed and bandaging the marmot up. Finally, she brings the sleeping marmot to an empty cage and places him gently on the cushioned bed inside.“I’ll keep an eye on him as he recovers. I won’t be able to release him until his wound is fully healed, but he should make a full recovery. Then we’ll bring him down to the greenbridge and release him back into his natural habitat. Don’t worry, marmots are stronger than they look. He’ll be okay.” She gives you a warm smile and shakes your hand. “You’ve done him a great service today. I don’t doubt he’ll never forget what you’ve done for him.”"

Out of respect, you set a cairn on the side of the trail and beseech the spirits to guide this one home. Your heart heavy, you set camp for the night. Hopefully, tomorrow brings better fortune."

You have no other choice but to make camp for the night. You set out some medical supplies and try to treat the animal’s injury as best you can. If you’re lucky, it’ll last the night and you can resume your trek in the morning."

You’ve tried your best, but it doesn’t seem likely that you’ll be able to reach the Biological Outpost in time to help your new friend. You set out some medical supplies and get to work patching yourself up first. Hopefully you can make camp for the night, treat the animal’s injuries and your own as best you can, and resume in the morning. If you’re lucky, it’ll last the night."

Seems you have two charges to protect now, but your responsibility is first and foremost to the humans of the Valley. You send up a starspark that soars high into the air and explodes with light. You’re going to need help if you are to care for both of them at the same time. "

I’m not as good at treating people as I am animals, but I’ll see what I can do.” With Sirisana’s attention focused on you for the time being, you can only hope your animal friend holds out in the meantime."

You can only hope your animal friend holds out in the meantime."
