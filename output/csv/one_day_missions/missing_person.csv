You peer through the rain as you scan the banks of the river for any sign of Ren Kobo or his signature hoversled. It’s been a week since the Messipian was supposed to make an appearance at his market west of Spire, and folks are starting to worry.
Yesterday, one of the fisherfolk found a small box washed up on the Silverfin’s banks a bit south of White Sky and brought it to the Rangers. Ren Kobo isn’t the only one to use boxes of that make, but it’s the best sign you’ve had so far, so Lyn Mira lent one of her canoes to aid you in a fast search along the river."
one_day_missions.missing_person.narration_2,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/one_day_missions/missing_person,"The rain has been relentless, and the river has been swelling in recent days. You could stay here and search where the box was found, but assuming he was taken by the river, Ren Kobo could be anywhere along its length!
The river splits around the island that holds Spire. Given the number of the people in that area, surely someone there spotted something. Otherwise, if he made it past Spire, he’s most likely washed up in the Alluvial Ruins with all the river’s detritus. Either would be a good place to start, as would right here."

The rain has washed away any tracks on the riverbank, but you quickly identify some disturbed and broken branches that speak of something large blundering through the bushes. Something like Ren Kobo’s hoversled. A good sign! You decide to continue down this trail."

You paddle around a bend to see Spire ahead of you, a dim silhouette through the downpour. As you draw closer, you spot several figures urgently waving and beckoning you towards the shore. A woman wrapped in a thick poncho greets you as she helps pull your canoe onto the shingle. “Are we ever glad to see you! Are you the ones looking for ol’ Ren Kobo? You’re going to want to see this.”
She leads you to a pile of boxes stacked on the shore and points toward the woods. “We found some footprints in a sheltered area up there, but we’re no trackers. Think you can take it from here?”"

Finally, the current slows as the river widens into a massive alluvial fan. The trunks of dead trees and scattered ruins of ancient structures dot the field of detritus washed here by the Silverfin. It doesn’t take you long to spot some signs of Ren Kobo. Not only do you find several boxes, but you also notice a torn piece of his poncho, tied hastily to a branch as a sign. Clearly he knew he was in trouble, and knew someone would come looking for him. Hopefully all the other signs will be this easy to find."

They don’t notice you as they graze on the contents of an overturned hoversled -- Ren Kobo’s overturned hoversled! You quickly look around and spot the merchant hiding behind a boulder.
He locks eyes with you, and makes an emphatic “no” gesture. He appears to be frightened, but of what you're not sure. Certainly, he can't be afraid of a few herbivores."

As you do, you hear an audible groan from the merchant. “No, you fools!"" he says. ""She’ll see you!”
Suddenly, a massive shadow moves across the sun, and your hair stands on end. You know of only one being in the Valley large enough to cast such a shadow. You’re going to need to get Ren Kobo, and yourself, to the safety of a Ranger Station as quickly as possible."

“Umbra!” he hisses. “She swooped down and overturned my sled, and I've been hiding here ever since! I'd run, but a Messipian never abandons his merchandise!”
You tell him you can keep him safe, but he'll need to leave his sled behind for now. You need to reach a Ranger Station as quickly as possible."

 You have been hiking abreast with Ren Kobo, though he’s been less talkative than normal. Perhaps his run-in with Umbra has left him more shaken than he's let on.
At long last, you crest a hill to be greeted by the welcoming sight of the Ranger Station. A few minutes later, the old Messipian is sitting down with a cup of hot broth, drying off from the rain.
“Thank you,” Ren Kobo says. “This is why I love the Valley so much.” He clasps your hands. “It's full of exceptional people that you can always rely upon in your hour of need.”

 Ren Kobo’s injuries have been wearing on him more and more as you travel, but at long last you see the Ranger Station in the distance. A few minutes later, you’re inside, and the old Messipian is sitting down with a cup of hot broth, drying off from the rain as you tend to his bumps and bruises.
“Thank you,” he says. “People like you are why I love this Valley so much.” He clasps your hands. “Once you're done patching me up, we should probably go back for my merchandise. What do you say?”"

Although he insists he’s fine, you can tell the old Messipian is in trouble. You put his arm over his shoulder and heave his weight up. You can still get him to safety."

You sit beneath the shelter of a tall, sturdy oak and drift off to sleep.
Some hours later a light kick against your boot rouses you from your slumber. You look up to see another Ranger by the name of Kal Iver standing beside none other than Ren Kobo. ""You can call off the hunt,"" says Kal. ""Ren Kobo has been found. Next time, I recommend you keep your eyes open. It helps with the searching!""
Ren Kobo tips his hat toward you as he and Kal Iver continue down the trail."

Leaning against a tree, you stifle a moan. You’ve tried your best, but you can’t continue the search for Ren Kobo in this state. You decide to rest and treat your injuries.
After drinking an invigorating tea and wrapping your wounds in blue kelpweed, you begin to feel much better. Then, you hear the sound of voices from up the trail. You call out, and are soon greeted by the sight of a small party of Rangers accompanied by none other than the Messipian merchant, Ren Kobo.
As they approach, Ren Kobo reaches into his cloak. ""Let me see if I have something for those wounds of yours!"" he says. You sigh at the irony, but are glad for the help."

You flop down against a large, moss-covered rock. Ren Kobo slides down the rock next to you, panting.
“We’ve come a long way, but I can see it in your face that we’re not making it any further today.” The old Messipian gives you a compassionate smile. “The good news is that I think that giant raptor only hunts during the day! We should be safe to set up camp.”
Ren Kobo takes hold of your arm, and leaning on each other for support, you and he stand, then begin to make camp. You didn’t quite make it to the Ranger Station, but at least you know that Ren Kobo is safe."

Ren Kobo puts your arm over his shoulder and heaves you to your feet. “We aren’t done yet!” he says.
With a strength you didn’t know the merchant possessed, he supports your weight as you continue down the trail. It looks like you won’t be the one doing the rescuing today after all."
