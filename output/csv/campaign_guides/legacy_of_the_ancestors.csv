campaign_guides.legacy_of_the_ancestors.the_story_so_far.narration_1,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/prologue,"You've come to the end of a long day's journey. Your legs ache, yet you feel invigorated. A light breeze rustles your cloak and cools the perspiration on your skin. You take a deep, full breath. Crisp mountain air fills your lungs, and you feel it all the way down to the soles of your feet. You exhale and taste the sweetness of the air on your tongue.
On this day, you're returning home after a weeks-long patrol of the Northern Pass. The hour is late, and the shadow of Atrox Mountain stretches out before you, reaching eastward across the Valley's many forests, lakes, and streams.
As evening deepens, the song of frogs and chirping insects rises from the grasslands. Your path has led you out of the mountains and down to the foothills of Atrox Mountain, where tall trees now stand on all sides and the air is rich with the smell of pine and loamy earth. In the distance, you see a welcome sight.
Visible for miles even in the failing light, Lone Tree Station stands out against the evening sky. The sight of your home fills you with relief. After weeks on patrol, you are eager to get a warm meal and a good night's rest. You hear the distant sound of laughter and merrymaking on the wind.
The sun dips below the mountains, painting the clouds in a rich vermilion. The leaves of Lone Tree glitter in the evening light, and you smell rain on the air."
campaign_guides.legacy_of_the_ancestors.the_story_so_far.narration_2,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/prologue,"Lone Tree Station towers before you, its great limbs dark against the sky. From its base a warm light glows. A boisterous song fills the air—a traditional tune from the time when your ancestors roamed the Midlands, a song of reverent joy and the beauty of nature. As accompaniment to the song, you smell a savory aroma, one that could only come from the kitchen of Hy Pimpot.
Stomach rumbling, you decide to forego a visit to your quarters and make for the Old Ranger's Root, the tavern at the base of Lone Tree Station, operated by veteran Ranger and celebrated hunter, Kordo Haverson.
Kordo greets you with a smile, and the gruff but amiable veteran accompanies you to the coziest of the Old Ranger's Root's dimly lit corners. You ease back against a smooth wooden bench and take in your surroundings.
The tavern occupies a large hollow at the base of Lone Tree Station. The tree's roots both form the dome of the tavern's ceiling and support its walls. The great room is furnished with artfully crafted wooden tables and chairs. Along the walls, smaller roots serve as benches, worn smooth with use. The tavern is full and spirits are high. 
""Back from your patrol of the Northern Pass, eh?"" Kordo says. ""Find any reclaimers up there? No? If you ask me, I reckon we've seen the last of them. Good riddance to bad biomelds, I say!""
Two cycles of the moon have passed since you and your fellow Rangers made safe the Valley from the reclaimers—a rare species of biomeld that endangered all who crossed their path, and that very nearly consumed the village of Spire. Since then, however, the Valley has been comparatively quiet. 
Kordo orders a round of Mulcher's Brown—a rich, nutty ale—for the table and sits beside you. After weeks on the trail, it's nice to be in the company of your fellow Rangers, sharing stories over a hearty brew. 
Conversations dwindle, and you look up to see a flamboyantly dressed woman carrying a dolewood lute step up to the low stage near the bar. You recognize her as Sasha Vero, a traveling talespinner from Meadow. An expectant hush falls over the crowd. 
Sasha looks out at the patrons and begins to stomp her foot on the stage, pounding out an energetic beat that is quickly taken up by those in attendance. Soon, everyone in the tavern is clapping along, stomping their feet, or keeping time with their mugs on the table.
The tale is half sung, half spoken to a vigorous beat accompanied by percussive strums of the lute. She begins:
Ooooh, let me tell you a tale my friends. My friends, let me spin you a yarn. I sing the deeds of the brave and noble Rangers who saved our Valley from harm.
Her resonant voice fills the Old Ranger's Root from corner to corner, and the strums of her lute dance upon the air.
Sasha's story begins several cycles past, when some fresh recruits first donned their cloaks and were assigned their first mission—a mission of tremendous importance. 
""Biscuit delivery!"" Sasha cries, and the crowd roars with laughter. It's in this moment that you realize that her song is about you!
The Rangers bore their basket of delights and filled the bellies of their neighbors. Only a few of those biscuits did they sneak as they went about their labors."
campaign_guides.legacy_of_the_ancestors.the_story_so_far.narration_3,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/prologue,"You smile as you remember savoring Hy Pimpot's warm, buttery biscuits. Was that really such a short time ago? That was also the day you met Kal Iver. You remember Kal's disdainful attitude and let out a laugh, thinking of how your relationship with him has grown. You spot Kal sitting across the room. He catches your eye and gives you a playful wink."
campaign_guides.legacy_of_the_ancestors.the_story_so_far.narration_4,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/prologue,"You lean toward Kordo and tell him that you would never do that! Kordo laughs. ""Hy Pimpot would be sorely disappointed to hear it!"" He says. ""He always bakes more than enough for just such an eventuality."" You settle back into your seat and your mind drifts to memories of Calypsa, your mentor, who made a bet with her patrolmate Kal Iver that you wouldn't eat any of the biscuits. You smile to yourself, thinking of how you proved that her confidence in you was not misplaced."
campaign_guides.legacy_of_the_ancestors.the_story_so_far.narration_5,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/prologue,"Sasha continues her tale, singing of the shaper, Aell, the dangerous rainstorms he inadvertently summoned, and the subsequent floods that revealed the presence of the invasive biomelds known as the reclaimers. She tells of how the Rangers encountered a mysterious Verdessian, a sentient plant who was unceremoniously killed—eaten by a sitka buck that mistook it for a meal. Was it connected to the reclaimers somehow? We'll never know!"
campaign_guides.legacy_of_the_ancestors.the_story_so_far.narration_6,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/prologue,You remember that the Verdessian was unlike anything you had ever seen. Its death was a tragedy. The Verdessian had acted with purpose and intelligence. You regret missing the opportunity to learn more about it. 
campaign_guides.legacy_of_the_ancestors.the_story_so_far.narration_7,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/prologue,"As the song continues you tell Kordo what really happened. With the help of Spirit Speaker Nal you had a ""conversation"" with the Verdessian. It was very difficult to understand. In the end, however, you discovered that the Verdessian was trying to lure the reclaimers to Spire for some reason you couldn't discern. Kordo nods, clearly impressed."
campaign_guides.legacy_of_the_ancestors.the_story_so_far.narration_8,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/prologue,"As the song continues, you tell Kordo what really happened. With the help of Spirit Speaker Nal you communicated with the Verdessian and discovered that its motives were complex. It was trying to guide the reclaimers toward destroying something beneath Spire, something it viewed as a threat. You wonder aloud what the threat could have been and whether that threat persists. Kordo nods, clearly unnerved by the thought."
campaign_guides.legacy_of_the_ancestors.the_story_so_far.narration_9,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/prologue,"Sasha's song reaches a crescendo! With the whole of the Valley in danger, the only thing to do was to evacuate Spire and move the residents to safety. With only hours to spare, the Rangers came to the rescue and whisked the villagers away."
campaign_guides.legacy_of_the_ancestors.the_story_so_far.narration_10,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/prologue,"You remember the terror of that day. You managed to get everyone to safety, even as the reclaimers swarmed the village. Spire was heavily damaged before the reclaimers poured into the Arcology Threshold, disappearing into the darkness below. "
campaign_guides.legacy_of_the_ancestors.the_story_so_far.narration_11,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/prologue,"You tell Kordo of how you sought the help of the shaper Aell, and how he used a special conduit to summon a final, mighty rainstorm to flood the reclaimer nest, washing them away for good. Kordo shakes his head in amazement. ""Incredible,"" he says. ""Simply incredible."""
campaign_guides.legacy_of_the_ancestors.the_story_so_far.narration_12,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/prologue,"You describe to Kordo how you worked with Kasende, the hunter from Tumbledown, to lure the reclaimers into the Marsh of Rebirth using a strange white flower as bait. Their appetites were matched—and exceeded—by the hydraworms of the swamp. In a feeding frenzy, the reclaimers were devoured. ""I wish I could have seen it!"" Kordo says. ""That's what I call nature at work!"" "
campaign_guides.legacy_of_the_ancestors.the_story_so_far.narration_13,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/prologue,"With a final, energetic verse and a boisterous stomp, Sasha brings the tale to a close. As the crowd erupts in applause, she makes a sweeping gesture toward you. ""To the heroes!"" she shouts, and the crowd echoes the toast with raised mugs. ""Thank you, one and all! May the ancestors guide you. I'll be here all week! Good night!""
Kordo claps your shoulder. ""Quite the tale,"" he says, draining his mug. ""Now go get some rest. I have a feeling you'll be back on the trail before you know it.""
As you leave the Old Ranger's Root, a stiff wind rustles the leaves of Lone Tree. You close your cloak against the chill and head inside the station."
campaign_guides.legacy_of_the_ancestors.1_missions_loa.narration_1,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/missions,"You wake with the dawn. The unmistakable aroma of Hy Pimpot's pancakes rouses you from your slumber. Birdsong drifts through the open window, and you raise your head to see the first rays of sunlight peek over Mount Nim. As a Ranger you've grown accustomed to sleeping under the stars, but every once in awhile, it's nice to sleep in a comfortable bed, sheltered from the elements."
campaign_guides.legacy_of_the_ancestors.1_missions_loa.narration_2,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/missions,"As you lie snug and warm, you recall a portion of the dream you had last night. You were in a dark cave, your surroundings barely illuminated. You remember the stillness of the air and the sound of a trickling stream. There was a being there with you, cloaked in shadow. As the light crawled slowly over its form, revealing it bit by bit, it turned its head toward you—a head like a many-petaled flower, ""grinning"" in a fashion that filled you with deep unease.
Your memory of the dream fades as you climb out of bed, and remember that you have an early meeting with Elder Thrush. You dress quickly and head straight to the kitchen for breakfast. You know from past experience that if you don't hurry, the pancakes will all be eaten and you'll have to settle for sunberry-mash and cream. 
You pull on your tunic, step onto the balcony, and notice a darkened sky to the south. After several weeks of nearly perfect weather, heavily laden clouds have swept up from the Verdessa. It begins to rain. "
campaign_guides.legacy_of_the_ancestors.1_missions_loa.narration_3,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/missions,"You weave your way through the covered stairways of Lone Tree Station, and as you reach Elder Thrush's ready room, your ears are filled with the rolling thrum of raindrops pelting the roof. 
Elder Thrush stands at the far end of a circular table that dominates the center of the room. Carved from the trunk of a giga-redwood slain by lightning, the table bears faint scorch marks beneath a generous coat of lacquer.
In the center of the table sits a marvelous piece of technology: a multi-hued map of kinetic glass, large enough to depict the entire Valley. With a gesture from Elder Thrush, the surface of the Valley lifts, revealing partially mapped passageways in the ground below. 
Spirit Speaker Nal and Ben Amon are there as well, speaking quietly to each other. As you enter they sit at attention. Elder Thrush studies the shimmering map for a moment, then gestures for you to take a seat across from her.
""Good morning,"" she says in a friendly, no-nonsense tone. ""I trust you slept well last night? I know that you were looking forward to some extended free time after your long patrol, but the people of the Valley are in need once again."" You sit up a little straighter. ""Do you know Silaro Mako?""
You tell Elder Thrush that you are familiar with the Valley's foremost archaeologist and enthusiast of Estian lore.
""You may not have felt it since you were patrolling the Northern Pass, but while you were gone, there was a tremor near Spire. It was barely perceptible here at the Station, and it did not last more than a few moments, but there are many who believe it was an event of great importance.
""Silaro Mako is one of them. He believes that something has … shifted deep within the arcology ruin, and he's eager to investigate. A few days ago, he approached the Council of Elders with a proposal: He wants to lead an expedition into the depths of the arcology to discover the source of the tremor.""
""Elder,"" says Ben Amon, raising a finger. ""If I may, Silaro's theory is well founded in historical fact. Long ago, when the Valley was first settled by our ancestors, there was a tremor not unlike this one. Our ancestors already knew of the arcology ruin beneath Spire, but after the tremor, Sal Orlin, Elder Orlin's father, discovered that a passage had opened near the surface.""
Ben Amon gestures toward the map and the kinetic shards reform to show a detailed view of the Arcology Threshold. A passage within leads to a spiral staircase set inside a deep chimney—a narrow, vertical chasm—plunging far below the surface.
""He went in not knowing what awaited him, and he returned with the Carbon Forge; the most valuable piece of technology we have today. I have no doubt that Silaro hopes to find that another doorway has opened somewhere in the ruin, and that beyond lies an equally important discovery.""
Spirit Speaker Nal nods in agreement. ""There may be another element to this as well. Shortly after the reclaimers came and went, I felt the arcology stir. It's agitated. It has the energy of a scroff-tousled anthill, like it's been startled awake after a centuries-long slumber. I've never been so aware of the lifeforms underground or of the arcology itself. This tremor is no coincidence.""
""There is still much that we do not understand about the Estians,"" says Ben Amon. ""Perhaps the presence of the reclaimers caused an ancient failsafe to be triggered deep within the ruin, for there are many such cautionary tales concerning the relics of the ancestors and the dangers they pose to the unwary. It would be wise to temper our curiosity with caution.""
""Agreed,"" says Elder Thrush. ""It's been five years since the last expedition. Perhaps Calypsa spoke of it during your training. It was to be a simple excursion to Orlin's Vault, but tragedy must have befallen them, for none from the expedition were seen again."" She shakes her head. ""I recommended against this new expedition at the Council, but I found myself in the minority. I did agree, however, that it would be wise to send Rangers.
""This is where you come in. You are to aid Silaro, and the rest of the expedition, in whatever way you can. And, of course, you are to see to it that everyone returns alive and unharmed."" 
She gestures, and with the crystalline tinkling of thousands of shards of glass, the glittering map of the Valley reforms, taking the shape of Spire. 
""The easiest method by which you may descend into the arcology is by way of the Arcology Threshold in the village of Spire. However,"" she gestures again, and the map of the Valley returns, with certain areas marked by spinning golden flecks, ""there are numerous sinkholes and other entrances to the arcology scattered throughout the Valley as well. The route you take is up to you."""
campaign_guides.legacy_of_the_ancestors.1_missions_loa.narration_4,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/missions,"""May the Spirit of the Valley guide and protect you,"" she says. With that, Elder Thrush calls an end to the meeting and sends you on your way."

Within, there are the beginnings of a base camp. The advance team moves about the space, taking stock, unpacking crates, setting up equipment, and building temporary structures. Beyond, there is a vast darkness, sparkling with a strange kind of precipitation that illuminates the boundaries of the cavern as it falls. Shadows move and shift as the droplets pass. The effect is mesmerizing.
""Beautiful, isn't it?"" A confident voice cuts through the still air. You turn to see a tall, bearded man with impeccable posture walking toward you. ""We've been calling it glitterain. Not sure what it is, but it sure is fascinating! I'm Harlan. Harlan Vos,"" he says, extending his hand in greeting. ""You must be the additional Rangers Elder Thrush promised us.""
You introduce yourself and inquire as to Silaro Mako's whereabouts.
""Silaro went on ahead some time ago,"" explains Harlan. ""He got so excited when he arrived that he just had to venture deeper. I've never been one to stand in the way of an explorer, so I didn't protest, but it's been at least a day since he left. Maybe I should have tried to convince him otherwise.""
You are about to respond when you feel a familiar tug on your backpack.
""Hi!"" You look down to see the cheerful face of Quisi Vos looking up at you. Is she … eating your trail mix? ""I'm glad you're here. That other Ranger's not nearly as fun as you are. What was his name again, dad?"" 
""Kal Iver,"" says Harlan. ""He arrived a few hours before you did. Said that we should expect you to be right behind him 'as usual.' He went on ahead, but he didn't seem too worried about Silaro. Can you keep an eye out for him? Silaro is supposed to be leading this expedition, after all. He should probably be here."""
campaign_guides.legacy_of_the_ancestors.1_missions_loa.1_101.narration_2,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/campaign_guides/legacy_of_the_ancestors/missions/1_101#1101a,"The expedition's advance team has all but finished setting up on a large flat landing at the base of the Chimney. It looks like a small village, bustling with activity. Among the gathered crew, you spot the young rapscallion Quisi Vos talking excitedly with her father, Harlan, and your old rival, Kal Iver. 
Kal lies back on a hammock suspended several feet above the ground by two memlev devices, one at the head of the hammock and one at its foot. As you approach, he hops off with a grunt of effort and steps toward Silaro Mako, giving you a laconic salute. ""You're in good hands, Silaro,"" he says. ""Elder Thrush has sent us the absolute best.""
""Of course she did!"" says Silaro. ""All the Elders know how important this expedition is. They'll also be happy to know that my theory was correct! New passages have opened up in the arcology! The last time anyone was down here, there was only one passage leading from this chamber. Now there are many more. I'd be willing to bet there are even more beyond those!"" With hardly a pause, Silaro turns to you and says: ""What I need you to do is a bit of scouting. First, investigate the immediate vicinity, then we'll see about venturing deeper.""
He rummages in a nearby crate and withdraws a handheld device. ""Take this lambance rig with you. Illumination is in short supply down here, and you don't want to go fumbling around in the dark—not where you're going!"" He claps you on the back. ""Drink it in, my friend.

If he were any more excited, he may very well float back up to the surface. ""While you're away, I plan on doing some 'scouting' of my own,"" he says. ""I've discovered some Estian script that may very well be instructions for how to operate the arcology itself! I just need time to translate it. Perhaps by the time you return, I'll know more."" "

When you explain that he's missed dinner, and perhaps some other meals besides, he shrugs. ""That explains why my belly has been rumbling, I suppose. There's just so much to discover down here! I could spend my entire life in these halls!"" 
You politely but persistently suggest that Silaro would be better off at the base camp organizing the operation, and that he can send others to scout in his stead. He keeps brushing off your suggestions until he stands up … and almost falls over on his face.

He steps deeper into the alcove and returns with a truly impressive piece of headgear. ""This beauty has been sitting unused in my storehouse for far too many seasons.""

As you turn to leave, the mole lets out a distressed chirp. Tiella regards him for a long moment.
""I think Gus wants to stay with you,"" she says. ""Clearly he's acquired a taste for adventure."" 
You protest, but Tiella shushes you. She nuzzles Gus one last time, then sets him gently back into his cage. ""Be safe out there, little man,"" she whispers. ""And come back to see me soon."" "

The rhythm of the thrum syncs with the occasional release of water into the chamber from the openings above, followed shortly thereafter by a low gurgling sound as that water is flushed from the chamber. You reflect on how great is the generosity of the Estians that they should leave so many mechanical wonders to be discovered and utilized by a people they would never meet in waking life."

However, these other forges are clearly in a state of horrible disrepair, perhaps beyond salvaging. You also find several depowered and disassembled machines, some as small as your closed fist, but others the size of a stilt horse.

In this moment, you become fully aware of the inherent stillness of the arcology, and you wonder: if you weren't down here tromping around, how much quieter it would be. Would it be wiser, perhaps, to leave this place undisturbed? Your thoughts drift to memories of the open sky and to the sweet scent of sunberries on the breeze.
You're stirred from your reverie by the sound of approaching footsteps and hushed conversation. To your surprise, Quisi Vos comes sprinting toward you, her way illuminated by a curious lantern—a transparent sphere containing what appears to be a glowing slug. You spot her father, Harlan, and Kal Iver walking calmly behind. Quisi sits down heavily beside you. ""This place is INCREDIBLE!"" she says. ""Look at this slug I found!"" Quisi is in the middle of recounting the Finding of the Slug when her father and Kal approach.
""Sorry to interrupt your story, Quisi,"" Harlan says. ""But we have a message from Silaro for our friend here."" He turns to you. ""Silaro's research has borne fruit, and he's off to the Concordant Ziggurats to put it to the test. He's requested your help in whatever he plans to do there, so he sent us on an errand to find you and deliver the message. Before we left, he was going on about the arcology being 'asleep' and just needing a nudge to wake up. I've never seen him so excited—and that's saying something.""
Kal steps forward. ""I'll take over the survey mission from here, so you can go help Silaro,"" he says. ""Silaro had a wild gleam in his eye when we left him. I'm not sure what to make of it. I think he may be more in need of your good sense than anything else you might provide."" You brief Kal on your survey progress and make note of the final location on your list.
Kal claps you on the shoulder. ""Leave it to me,"" he says.

As you mount the final step, Silaro looks up from his equipment—some sort of kinetic glass display. ""Oh good! You made it. And just in time!"" he says. ""I've uncovered something remarkable."" 
He gestures around him. ""We've long suspected that the Ziggurats are some sort of power source; maybe they generate power, or perhaps they bring it from somewhere else. But in any case, in the writings I've interpreted, the Estians refer to them as 'power nodes,' and together they provide energy to the arcology.
""I believe now that the new passages we've been exploring underground have been opened by the arcology itself! Some sort of autonomous reaction! And if that's true, I wonder what the arcology would do if we gave it a little more juice.""
You ask why Silaro assumes the Ziggurats aren't sending their power to the arcology already, and he points to his kinetic glass display. ""Look at these readings! The Ziggurats are bleeding energy off into their surroundings. It explains why we always feel so edgy around them. But the writings also explain how we can shift them, get the power under control, and redirect it back into the arcology where it belongs."" 
Silaro begins to demonstrate the process—using sympathetic resonance with a precise series of whistles—and you look at the other Ziggurats marching away into the distance. Looks like there's some more climbing in your future."

""Ah, you're here! Fantastic. We have a lot of work to do."" He gestures to several of the other nearby Ziggurats.

He pulls out a bronze, multi-toned whistle and begins blowing the precise notes. As he does, you look out over the Valley. Something catches your eye: the Tenebrae, which normally roam implacably near the Ziggurats, are drifting with uncharacteristic haste toward the mountains to the west. You are about to say something to Silaro when he blows the last crisp note.
As soon as it rings out, it's met with a clap of thunder as a massive electrical discharge ignites several meters above your head and leaps from the Ziggurat upon which you're standing to the next one in sequence, then the next, then the next.

No one speaks.
Every few minutes you feel another quake, but with each subsequent tremor, the intensity seems to decrease. Eventually, there is only a deep rumbling sound, coming from somewhere far below.
You hear the sound of approaching footsteps, and then the space is suddenly filled with light. Silaro Mako stands at the threshold, his brightly glowing lambance rig held aloft.
""I thought we might need some light—"" he starts, then looks and sees you, Quisi, Harlan, and Kal disheveled, covered in dust, battered, but alive. ""Oh, thank the ancestors!"" he says breathlessly. ""You're all safe! Oh, thank goodness!"" 
Silaro slumps against the wall in relief, and for once, his boundless enthusiasm seems to have left him. ""When we felt the first quake, I just knew … I knew that I had put you all in harm's way.

You instinctively place your hands on the ground or against a wall, trying to maintain your balance. Silaro stumbles, drops his lambance rig, and falls to the floor. Above you, the countless tons of rock and earth groan and creak … but hold. 
Without missing a beat, Silaro rolls into a sitting position and places his hands against the wall, feeling the vibration in the rock. When it stops, he opens his notebook and hastily scribbles something on the page. He speaks to himself under his breath, then looks at up at you, his eyes wide. 
""It's as I feared,"" he says. ""Whatever I did woke up the arcology alright, but not in the way I expected. I thought that maybe the lights would turn on, all the doors would open, or the 'preserved day' mechanisms would stabilize, but instead I think the whole system is trying to reactivate—machinery that's been dormant for centuries—perhaps attempting to execute some final directive instilled in it by the last of the Estians. There's no telling what will happen with all systems switched on and no one there to guide them. It could be collapsing on itself! What if the arcology systems somehow caused the Estians' extinction? The people of the Valley could be next!""
You put a hand on SIlaro's shoulder and remind him that there is no need to panic. You'll get to the bottom of this and set things right.
""Of course,"" he says. ""I'm being foolish. I honestly have no idea what's happening or what will happen in the days to come. All I know is that this is all my fault. I've put the entire Valley in jeopardy with my shortsighted behavior."" 
Silaro's voice is grave and firm. ""Whatever I hoped to learn down here doesn't matter anymore. We need to find whatever it is that's causing these quakes—perhaps a malfunctioning engine of some kind—and shut it down."" He looks at you, his eyes grim. ""I must ask for your aid once again, my friend. Please, help me correct this grievous error."""

I've always theorized that the Ziggurats were once a power source for the arcology. Then I found another translation that spoke of an 'activation sequence.' This was my chance to put my theory to the test!""
""I assumed that if I could activate the Ziggurats, they may give the systems down here in the arcology a boost. Perhaps they would cause some new passages to open, or power up a few ancient machines that we could investigate. Only I severely ... ah ... miscalculated. I had no idea how much power the Ziggurats would generate, nor how that power would affect the arcology."" 
""What's more, not only do we now have these earthquakes, but when the Ziggurats discharged their power, they also blanketed the entire Valley in electric fog!""

As various places became known to you, they became easier for me to access as well. So when you discovered the heart, I was able to see it clearly in my mind's eye, and much more besides.""
She closes her eyes and touches her fingers to her forehead. ""I can see pain and anguish billowing from the heart like black smoke,"" she says. ""It's become so accustomed to its despair and anger that it sees them as part of its very being, necessary to its survival.
""If we hope to help it, we must first learn more about it, and who better to ask than the Estians themselves? Together, we will seek them out, and learn what we can from them about the heart and its history.""
You ask how to find the spirits, and Nal gestures toward a path leading away from the knoll. ""Let the Valley guide you, for I have called upon her and she has agreed to help us. Follow the Valley's familiar paths, and they will lead you to these Estians.
""Your presence in the arcology is key. There are powers at work there that make it difficult to access remotely. To say it another way: I can't do this without you. You must gather the Estian spirits. I will be here to assist you in whatever way I can."" "

 At first you don't recognize the slender woman who crouches by the trail. Then you see the patch of mushrooms she is tending. In this dreaming place, the Gardener is whole once more, and looks no more or less living than you do. 
With her knowledge of the mycelial network that exists within the arcology, the Gardener knows not only a great deal about biology, but also about the link between biology and emotion. You ask her to follow you, and the Gardener straightens and falls into step behind you, still cradling a tiny fungal cap that glows a crackling pink. 
Wanderer Spirit:
 The way this faceless spirit strides purposefully forward before briefly pausing to study his surroundings is unmistakable to you. You recognize him as the Wanderer, the spirit who roams the halls of the arcology ceaselessly. In this dreaming place, he looks like he could be just as alive as you, though his face remains hidden. 
You feel that the Wanderer, of all the spirits, has the greatest understanding of the arcology. If part, or all, of the place is alive, he will understand it as few others can. You ask him to follow, and he bows as if to say, ""Of course.""
Archivist Spirit:
 Before you stands a solitary tree from the Arboretum of Memory, its branches swaying in an inperceptible breeze. At its base, you find the archivist in the middle of some task as he places his hand upon it and records something on his scroll. The spirit and the tree glow with a pale white light. He regards you for a moment, then returns to his work. 
If anyone would know precisely what happened to the arcology and its heart, it would be the Archivist. You ask him to follow, and after jotting a few more notes, he tucks his scroll away and walks forward. "

You wonder, are you sharing Nal's vision? Or is she sharing yours? Or is all this in your mind, nothing more than a product of your imagination?
""It matters not,"" Nal replies, though you did not speak your questions aloud. ""Such is the nature of being. Awake or dreaming, all is real. All is relevant. The Shapers understand this, and use tools which nullify the distinction. In this place, we need no tools, for we have our highest selves to guide us.""
She gestures toward the path, and you see with the eyes of a sparrowhawk as the way forward comes into glorious focus."

The sky has cleared during your journey, and where once was a tempest, now stars burn in the firmament with an almost painful intensity, each a different color that, somehow, you know is entirely unique. 
Nal is there, and she gestures for everyone to join her in a circle. You and the spirits take a seat, and it is not long before they begin to speak once again. This time, however, their ancient dialect seems to blend and harmonize. Nal begins to hum, low and resonant, and somehow the hum clarifies their voices as words take shape. After a moment, you realize you can now understand exactly what they are saying. 
""They wish to know about heart,"" the Wanderer says to the Archivist. 
You say that you do indeed, and ask them why there is a living heart at the center of the arcology. 
At this, the three spirits laugh. ""The heart is alive because the body it inhabits is alive,"" says the Gardener. ""How could it be otherwise?""
You ask her what body she's referring to. 
""Why, Vista, of course,"" says the Archivist. ""That which you call 'the arcology.' Know that many arcologies were built long ago, but Vista was the greatest of them all. Vista is the body, and the heart pumps its blood."" 
Nonplussed by their response, you ask the spirits if they can tell you why the heart is malfunctioning. 
""We all absorb the traumas that befall us,"" says the Wanderer. ""Vista, the heart, they are no different. The flood was a trauma to us all, and while most of us were fortunate enough to perish when it came, the heart lived on. Left alone to grapple with the death, the destruction, and the loss; then, being left alone in a darkened chamber for centuries. Its beating slowed as it slept to hide from its grief. Then power surged through it once more. In a moment it was jolted awake, and in that moment, it recalled a thousand years of grief, anger, and despair. It was too much for it to bear. It wishes only to forget. To sleep."" 
""Soothe the heart."" the Gardener says. ""Heal its trauma. Only by bringing it peace will the people of the Valley be safe.""
Nal's song fades, as so do the spirits. The tableau of Greenbriar Knoll begins to unravel as your physical surroundings nibble at the edges of the horizon. But even as the voices fade, you hear the Archivist, as if he was speaking directly into your mind. 
""Be warned!"" he says. ""Just as your mind and body are linked, so it is with the heart. If you wish the heart to live on, you must heal its physical ailments in addition to its emotional ones. You must be workers of flesh as well as the spirit.""

You're surpised to find that it appears to be fully functional, and unlike its counterpart, it beats at a steady rhythm.
After several hours of study, the evidence seems incontrovertible. Calling this a ""heart"" is too simplistic; the being the Estians created is that and so much more. 
The way the nerves link to wires and machine interfaces, plus the pseudo-biological liquids pumped through the valves and aortas, leaves no doubt. The Estians designed the entire arcology as a single living organism, and this device was grown to be its literal heart, but also its mind. You shake your head as you grapple with the immense skill and towering ambition of the Estians. To create such a thing -- to give it life, and then live within it -- no idea could sound less appealing to any who live under the open sky.
Nevertheless, the actual heart in the center of the arcology is clearly not operating as it should. It's clear from what you've observed of the prototype that it beats in response to electric pulses sent to it from the regulator. You wonder if perhaps delivering an electric shock to the heart might cause the system to reset, and return its rhythm to normal.
You consider working only with what you have at hand, and think back on all that you've discovered on your journey through the arcology. You begin to put together a mental list of components, starting with a capacative leech … "

For a two thousand year old, bio-engineered organism, it seems to you strangely ... human. In that moment of understanding, you are met with a vision.
In the vision, you are the Valley; the entire Valley. Your body stretches from the northerly mountain passes to the towering precipice of Tumbledown Falls, and everything in between. You watch as the Estians flourish, living within you, both above and below the surface. You nuture and protect them, and you are content. 
Then you watch in horror as the great dam breaks, and a towering wall of water sweeps it all away. People run, panicked. People die, drowned, or swept are over the falls, or trapped within your subterrean chambers with no hope of escape. And all the while, you can do nothing. 
The sorrow you feel is overwhelming. You want only to withdraw, to seal yourself off from the agony of witnessing those who gave you life, who lived within you, who you came to view as your children, perish. Surrounded by horrors and with nobody to turn to, you sink deep into despair. 
Centuries pass. The wilderness reclaims the surface as you steadily crumble and corrode.
Then, one day, you see something unexpected. Humans! People have arrived from the East, and they settle at the very place where your life began. They call it Spire. You use all of your remaining strength to offer them a gift, and open the way to the Carbon Forge. Soon they spread throughout the Valley, forming villages, transitioning from a nomadic people to a settled one. There is life in the Valley once again, and it brings you a measure of joy to witness it. 
But even as you watch these humans flourish, you see that your body, the arcology, is no longer within your control. It shakes and trembles in spite of your efforts, and every time it does, the new people of the Valley are put in greater danger. Perhaps, after so many centuries, you are finally ready to let go. With a deep sadness, you suspect that the only way to ensure their safety is to make the greatest sacrifice of all …

Silaro's face goes ashen when you tell of the collapse of the lower level of the arcology. ""By the ancestors!"" he says. ""You mean to say it's just ... gone? Destroyed? All that history, all those records, buried forever."" 
Kordo shakes his head, and claps you on your shoulder. ""It doesn't matter,"" he says bluntly. ""The important thing is, you're safe. Your lives, and the lives of all our expedition members, matter far more than any dusty old tome.""
Silaro slowly nods. ""You're right, of course."" But you can see the gleam of unspilled tears in his eyes. 
SAVED THE HEART:
""By the ancestors, you did it!"" says Silaro, grinning from ear to ear. ""After my foolish mistake with the Ziggurats, I thought I had doomed us all! But not only did you save the Valley, you preserved its heart as well! Amazing!"" 
""More than simply amazing."" You didn't see Ben Amon arrive, but there he is, arms crossed and a smile on his face. ""We've already started to notice changes on the surface. It appears as though some of the ruins are repairing themselves! There's no telling how our lives will be affected by this development, or what it will mean for future generations. A living, intelligent structure! It boggles the mind."" 
Elder Thrush puts a hand on Ben Amon's shoulder. ""Only time will tell,"" she says. ""In the meantime, we will continue to safeguard the Valley, and all that lives within it.""
She turns now to you. ""You should be proud! You've lived up to the highest standards of our order, protecting all life, even one as strange as the ancient marvel you've discovered. We all owe you a debt of gratitude. The people of the Valley will not soon forget what you've accomplished. Well done!""
SILENCED THE HEART:
Silaro's face looks pained as you finish your story. He takes a deep breath and speaks, his voice quavering. 
""How tragic! I knew my error with the Ziggurats had put us in a dire situation. That you were able to discover the heart, and even tried to help it … well, that's far more than anyone could expect."" Elder Thrush nods in agreement. ""Indeed. You lived up to the highest standards of our order, protecting all life in the Valley to the best of your ability. Even the heart, however strange was the life that it lived."" 
You all stand silently for a moment. Then Silaro speaks up. ""It might be cold comfort,"" he says. ""But thanks to your efforts, the structural integrity of the arcology has been largely preserved. One can only imagine what we might learn from continued study of this place.""
You look at Silaro incredulously. He doesn't seem to notice. 
KILLED THE HEART:
Silaro's face looks pained as you finish your story. ""I knew my error with the Ziggurats had put us in a dire situation,"" he says. ""You did all you could, I'm sure.""
""Sounds to me like the heart was yet another creation of the ancestors run amok,"" says Kordo. He holds his darter close, and his eyes drift to the darkened corners of the chamber. ""A tragic tale to be sure, but if not for your actions we would be having this conversation at the bottom of a sinkhole.""
As you told your tale, Elder Thrush remained silent. She speaks now in a somber tone. ""I have no doubt that your actions prevented disaster,"" she says. ""As Rangers we bear the responsibility of protecting all life in the Valley, even though we are not always able to do so. The loss of the heart — its life in exchange for ours — is a grievous one. We must do all that we can to prove ourselves worthy of its sacrifice."" 
CONSULTED THE SPIRITS:
Nal steps through the gathered crowd, and meets you with a warm embrace. 
""It's good to see you,"" she says. ""After our experience with the spirits of the Estians, I decided that I had to see the arcology for myself. Now that I'm here, however, I think I'm ready to go home."" Nal looks wistfully toward the spiral stairway. ""Even after communing with the spirits of the Estians, it's difficult for me to imagine why so many of them chose to live underground. They truly were a unique and fascinating people."" She laughs.

SAVED THE TEAM:
""Hiiiiii!"" A familiar, high-pitched voice rises above the din. Quisi Vos runs toward you at full speed and leaps into a hug. Somehow, you manage not to spill your drink.
Not far behind are her parents, Harlan and Oura, walking arm in arm.
""Quisi and Harlan told me all about what happened during the first earthquake,"" Oura says. She takes your hand in hers. ""Thank you for saving them.""
You smile, and say you're welcome. It's all in a day's work.
BESTED KAL:
""Hey!"" Kal steps forward, punching you good-naturedly in the arm. ""Glad to see you made it in one piece!"" 
He smiles. ""I knew you were the right choice for this mission. As you well know, I've never once doubted your abilities!"" 
You dramatically raise an eyebrow, and you and Kal both burst into laughter.
He passes you a canteen that, from the smell, is full of Kordo's best cherrymoss brandy. You both take a swig, toasting each other and basking in the glow of friendship forged through adversity.
VISIONS OF THE VERDESSA:
You raise your arms, and the hubbub dies down. You explain that there's one more part to the story, and tell the assembly about the return of the Verdessian. After you explain the visions it shared with you and the strange and unsettling problems brewing deep in the jungle, you see nervous faces and begin to hear worried mutters. 
""I thought that the Verdessian's behavior during the reclaimer invasion seemed a bit odd,"" says Sirisana Mir. ""Your story makes some sense of it at least. Perhaps we should investigate. For my part, I wouldn't say no to an opportunity to explore the Verdessa."" 
""I agree,"" Kordo grunts. ""We may need to go take a look for ourselves."" 
Voices rise at this comment, and there is suddenly a lot of excited chatter. Then Elder Thrush raises her arms for quiet. ""No one is going to the Verdessa,"" she says. ""Not yet at least. We will discuss this further at the next council of elders. For now, I see no cause for concern."" "

The sun is just rising above the mountains, warm winds and clear skies heralding the summer day to come. You close your eyes and feel the sunlight on your skin.

She stares over the Valley for a moment, gathering her thoughts. ""You know, it's strange. Since his body got washed away, it's hard to believe he's really dead. Sometimes, when I hear a really close thunderstrike, I look up, half expecting to see Aell with that impish grin on his face."" 
She shakes her head. ""But the Spirit Speakers all say his spirit is at peace. And that is certainly a lot."" 
You nod silently, remembering the last time you saw Aell—his arms spread wide as he summoned the storm, standing defiantly as the waters swirled around him, refusing to cease his call until the reclaimers were all washed away, even as the waters swept him from view. After a minute, you mention that his legacy is one the Valley will remember for generations.

You step through the hatch, only to find yourself on a platform suspended at the roof of a cyclopean well. The space seems to stretch off in all directions for kilometers, interrupted only by gargantuan hexagonal stone pillars covered in strange silver machinery. And beneath that …
Far below, the remnants of a vast ocean lap at the bases of the pillars. The sea is illuminated by a diffuse glow that seems to come from the very air of the well, and with it you can see the water is crystal clear, without the slightest impurity or living thing. You've found yourself in a monstrous storage well in the arcology's depths, one that clearly used to store a sterile sea. But what did the Estians need with so much purified water?"

However, the clusters of habitations you pick your way through are exactly that. Most are single rooms designed for one or two people, with beds, cabinets, and shelves cunningly shaped into the walls. The effect is that the rooms were somehow grown from carbonforged composites. 
Most of the rooms have been somewhat or fully overgrown with moss, greenery, and the seemingly ever-present fungi, but you still find traces of their former owners. Cups and bottles sit on dust-covered shelves, warm golden light radiates from a few of the large globes inset into the walls, and in a couple of rooms, you swear you hear the faint sound of birdsong—although you can't find any living birds anywhere."

Soon the stairwell opens into a labyrinthine network of dark, cramped passages, run through with pipes, wires, conduits, and ducts.

There they expand into thick mats of leaves—an inverted forest. 
The whole scene is illuminated by the steady glow of bioluminescent fungi growing from the ceiling. In fact, as you kneel down to look at the leaves and see just how pale they are, you suspect this entire forest lives off the dim but constant light. "

You scramble up the trunk and, with some effort, you're able to swing into the entrance to the treehouse. Within it, you find a terrible sight. A pitiful collection of bones lies in the corner, still wrapped in the rotten scraps of a gray, ironwool cloak. A quick inspection of the remaining belongings confirms your suspicions: this is one of the members of the expedition.
You check over the body and do not find any evidence of animal attack or injury. What you do find, however, are empty food sacks and provision pouches. You wonder if the expedition member ran out of food. You haven't seen many possibilities for forage in the Inverted Forest, and perhaps they grew too weak to return to the surface.

Soon, the flowsteel is shifting like water in response to your commands. You determine how to switch the map to a top-down image of the arcology's levels.

As you scan away from the passageways, the flowsteel shifts quickly into a series of habitation blocks. Suddenly, you stop and zoom in.

You recall Elder Thrush's description of that ill-fated expedition. You had thought that no trace of them was ever found; and you say as much to Silaro. 
The archaeologist nods, and you catch a glimpse of Silaro's old enthusiasm beneath his somber demeanor. ""Correct you are, and many of us spent our fair share of time looking. But as I searched the maze-like corridors to the north of here, I came across this in the midst of what appeared to be an old campsite.""
Silaro leans closer and opens the book, pointing to several entries in turn. ""It's incomplete, and there's been some damage. But this is definitely the expedition's logbook! I think if I review the entries and crosscheck them with some of the things we've discovered in the last few days …"" His voice trails off, and the brief enthusiasm fades. ""But I fear I have no time to investigate this further at the moment, intriguing as it may be.""
You do not hesitate to offer your assistance, and suggest that if Silaro doesn't have time to follow up on this, you just might. After all, you reason, once you review the logbook, it won't be too difficult for you to keep an eye out for clues as to the expedition's fate.

You get the sense that this spirit was someone who shouldered a great burden of responsibility in life. Perhaps he was something like an Elder or even a Ranger. Whatever his former role, he clearly cared deeply for the people who lived here, and still holds a great deal of grief for their loss.

Despite this, you get the strong sense from his tone that he desires to be free. Perhaps he has been doomed to walk the same path for centuries, revisiting a past he would just as soon forget. If you can help this spirit break free from his familiar patterns, he might be able to move on. "

The moment you have the thought, you spot something at the foot of the door, covered in dust: a note scrawled in a hasty script.
""I couldn't wait any longer. I'm going beyond the flooded passage, beneath the main artery, to the chamber where the Estians once slept. Don't worry, Hollan, I can handle myself. —Timo""

Lunn gestures to his overstuffed pack. ""You never know what you'll need out in the wilderness, let alone in this strange, subterranean maze.

""I went to the Golden Shore to give them a try. Ren Kobo warned me that they were running low on juice, and he wasn't wrong! After about a minute of breathing easy as can be, the thing stopped working. I had to swim for my life!"" He shakes his head. ""You know me. I love to tinker! But I couldn't get it to work with our power cells. I thought maybe I'd find something down here that could help. It runs on the quantumly entangled photons contained in these little glass cubes the Estians were fond of. Let's call them 'quantum cubes' for short. I've found some in the rubble, but so far they're all either dead or broken.""
Lunn lifts a collar from the case. ""You know what?"" he says. ""I think you should take them with you. Usually, I'd want something in trade, but the universe conspired for us to cross paths here in this isolated sinkhole, and I have a feeling this is the reason.""

""I don't have the replacements here to fix it, so I suppose I'll have to be content with exploring this place."" He gestures toward the open door with his thumb.

Besides Hollan, the expedition's three other members were a shaper named Yara, an explorer named Xavi, and an artificer named Timo. Much of the logbook details the preparations for the expedition: records of food and supplies, training runs on caves along the western edge of the Valley, and endurance hikes up and down the Silverfin. Then, the expedition sets off from Spire.
The first three days are spent cataloging and mapping the spaces just below Spire. You know they are pretty well explored, but as you go through Hollan's notes, you realize that you had no idea just how extensive even those passageways are. It appears Hollan planned to be extremely thorough as she and her team hoped to map the enitrety of the arcology from top to bottom."

The space rises vertically above us some dozen meters or more, and it descends to an impenetrable darkness. Xavi dropped a 500 meter plumb line without hitting bottom, so we knew we had quite the descent ahead of us.
The shaft can be traversed by a wide spiral ramp. Platforms and walkways split from it at intervals. I think there was some order to them once, but many have sheared off or collapsed. So far, Yara's foresight has helped us safely navigate the ramp's many fissures and gaps.
By evening, we had descended well past 500 meters, but the bottom of the ramp was nowhere in sight. It is difficult for me to imagine how Sal Orlin and his apprentices were able to transport the Carbon Forge to the surface using this passage. It must have deteriorated greatly in the one hundred years since.
The gloom is absolute, and the light of Timo's lambance rigs reaches only a sort distance. After making camp on the ramp, we had a spirited debate on whether we should be exploring the passageways that branch off from the shaft, but I have decided that we will first find the bottom of this pit as a group."

It was an autonomous machine of some kind. Apparently disinterested in us it continued south through a darkened passage. Timo wanted to pursue it, but I convinced him to wait until we were more thoroughly prepared.
Xavi returned from his scouting expedition in time for breakfast, having discovered a chamber he described as ""another world with a night sky all its own."" He provided us with directions and a crude map so that we might see it for ourselves, but stayed only long enough to eat and resupply before he struck off once again on his own.

His absence most worries Yara, who has begun to advocate that we go in search of him. That would be foolish. We would only become lost ourselves.
I have begun mapping the central, arterial corridor that seems to span the entirety of the underground complex, and found that there is energy still running through this place as well as pipes filled with clean, flowing water. The presence of the ancient Estians is palpable in their works. Much of it still stands, and resembles somewhat the ruins found on the surface.
Yara and I argued about where we should focus our priorities. Timo might have been the tie breaker, but he was busy investigating the wreckage of what he has dubbed a ""lightbringer;"" a type of ambulatory machine that we have spotted on more than one occassion, busied with some unknown purpose, while carrying with it a warm, illuminating glow.
Timo is clearly in his element. He feels a kinship with the Estians, who he sees as exemplary artificers from whom there is much for him to learn."

He said that someone called to him in his sleep, and that he then, like a spirit speaker, spent the next several hours in deep conversation with the lost spirit of an engineer who described to him the former function of much of the technology that Timo has catalogued on the journey. As a result, he has become even more enthralled by this place.
In the afternoon, Yara found something of interest: a patch of mushrooms the likes of which we have never seen. I didn't take her for a botanist, but she has somehow become convinced that these mushrooms are the biggest discovery down here, despite being surrounded by the inumberable wonders devised by the Estians.
The day ended with no sign of Xavi. Yara is ready to abandon the expedition to go in search of him, but I believe that he is safe, and will find his way back to us in time."

In the meantime, Timo and I will continue to investigate the branches of the main artery, and then begin our ascent once Yara returns."

Ral caustically notes that the success of the spindlescuttlers has finally shut down attempts to dig the caverns using ""quark waveform detonations"" and their ""only .1% chance of unleashing a cascading collapse that would destroy all of Colorado."" 
It seems like the Estians were in a hurry to construct Vista (which you think is the name they gave the Arcology) because of worsening lightning storms. The spindlescuttlers were essential to dig out the arcology, even as a massive reservoir was excavated just beyond the Bitter Pass, at the head of the Silverfin, to capture the excessive rain and prevent the Valley from flooding. A hydroelectric dam was then constructed to supply the arcology with power. 
Several entries later, you find the first references to the arcology needing more power than the dam could provide, and the development of some sort of ""perpetual biofusion reactor"" being grown for eventual installation in the arcology's depths. Later references refer to the reactor being given autonomous control over Vista's various mechanical systems. 
The later entries you find seem to be concerned with resources being devoted towards two competing projects that were taking up more and more attention within Vista. The entries don't say what those projects are, but you do find their names. One is the Arbol Initiative. The other is the Mycelium Distributed Cognition Network. There are also entries referring to arguments between the supporters of each, and some strong arguments about the dangers of the Arbol Initiative. 
The final entry is a transcript of an emergency broadcast across Vista's systems. The dam at the head of the Valley suffered a catastrophic explosion due to a sudden, massive surge of energy. In a moment, the entire contents of the reservoir beyond the dam burst forth. Your blood runs cold as you imagine the implacable wall of water rushing toward the arcology, destroying everything in its path. There would have been no escape."

The various biomelds created here include many of the biomeld species found in the Valley (particularly spindlescuttlers, hydraworms, and puffercrawlers), as well as ones you've never heard of (such as a species referred to only as ""the descendants"")."

The protocol talks about the various security measures put in place to defend the trees and the information stored within them. These measures are physical, electronic, and even psychological (although you're not sure what that means). 
It looks like most of these security measures must have failed or shut down over the centuries (otherwise, your attempts to access the Arboretum would have been a lot more exciting). But the interesting element is just how important the Estians considered the Arboretum of Memory. It served as the data archives for the entirety of Vista while also storing so much information from the ancient world. Although the sheer amount of information makes searching for specifics problematic, you know that you hold the entire history of the Estians in your hands."

There is mention of the Cage in the deepest part of the arcology (mostly in reference to how hard it was to excavate), but any references to what that chamber was for have been lost. However, peculiarly, the record notes that 
MACHINES
 were used to excavate the Cage, poorly, before the Estians introduced a biomeld that could do the job instead. That information might be useful for identifying information specific to the Cage."

The chorus of life sings a different melody underground. Strange, but beautiful.
A small white crab scuttles by at your feet. It stops, faces you, then raises one claw into the air. After a moment, you raise your hand in response. Finding this acceptable, the crab continues on its way.  "

""Speaking of losing track, I thought you'd like to know that Silaro wandered back to base camp yesterday, bruised, bloodied, but none the worse for wear.

Kal sighs. ""But that's not why I'm here. Silaro's found something in the old Estian records.
