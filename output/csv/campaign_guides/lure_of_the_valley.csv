campaign_guides.lure_of_the_valley.prologue.narration_1,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/campaign_guides/lure_of_the_valley/prologue,"Imagine a low fire burning in the pre-dawn light. Imagine you’re wrapped in a warm cloak, breathing cool mountain air. You smell the smoke from the fire and the rich scent of pine.   
Last night you swore your oaths to the ancestors, to the elders, and to the spirit of the Valley. The sun begins to rise on your first day as a Ranger, a caretaker of the land, and a friend to its people.   
You watch as Elder Thrush retrieves her condenser kettle from a low branch, checks the water level, then places it onto the fire. As the water rises to boil, Calypsa, the Ranger who has mentored you for the past nine months, sets about crushing dried marrowleaf for tea in plain carbon forged cups.   
Once it’s ready, she hands you a cup. Steam pours off of it. It smells of the forest.   
Calypsa raises her cup. “To your true self.” She drinks, and you follow suit. The tea invigorates you, warmth spreading throughout your body. It feels amazing.   
Your eyes are drawn to the flame. As you watch, your eyes unfocus. You hear the voices of your ancestors. You can feel them with you. You can feel their support and their love. You hear them speak, and they remind you of your best qualities, the person you truly are.  
Who are you?"

Like you, I am a Ranger.” She speaks briefly with Elder Thrush, douses the fire, then turns to you. “We will travel from here to the Boulder Field. I’ll stay back and follow your lead.”"

A light breeze cools your skin, and it conjures a memory of your apprenticeship. You had finished your first day’s work, sweat cooling on your skin, overlooking the Silverfin—its water sparkling with the colors of sunset. You stood at a moment of promise. Now, as a newly sworn Ranger, you stand at another, buoyed by the lessons learned in your youth."

Voluminous clouds drift lazily overhead. You see Calypsa emerge from the trees and walk down the trail toward you. “Let’s walk together for awhile,” she says. “I need to share some last bits of wisdom with you. It may be some time until our paths cross again out here in the wild.”"
campaign_guides.lure_of_the_valley.prologue.narration_5,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/campaign_guides/lure_of_the_valley/prologue#18,"“ ... and that was the last time I went swimming near a lutrinal holt.” You and Calypsa share a laugh. She takes the hem of your cloak between her thumb and forefinger and nods solemnly. “You are now a Ranger of the Valley,” she says. “You are charged with protecting its people and lending aid to any in need, but while you do, take care to look out for each other. Your fellow Rangers will need you, and you will need them.”
She steps back and smiles. “It’s time to return to Lone Tree Station. I must go by a different route, but I will see you there.”"
campaign_guides.lure_of_the_valley.prologue.narration_6,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/campaign_guides/lure_of_the_valley/prologue#23,"You emerge from a line of trees and find yourself walking through a vast, rolling field. In the distance, you see the towering form of Lone Tree Station rising against the clear blue sky, and on the breeze you smell the hint of something sweet. Is someone baking?"
campaign_guides.lure_of_the_valley.1_missions.narration_1,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/campaign_guides/lure_of_the_valley/missions,"Cresting the gentle, grassy hill, you see the unmistakable silhouette of Lone Tree Station rise out of the highland plains before you. Lone Tree Station is aptly named. The single massive giga-redwood towers above the hills and swaying grass that surround it. You can just make out eaves and balconies among the gnarled bark, doors tucked into the winding roots, and hanging gardens suspended from branches.
As you draw closer, a woman in a freshly pressed cloak steps out from the main entrance and waves. Calypsa, your mentor for the past nine months, strides toward you with a man who looks just about your age at her heels.
“Hallo!” she calls out. “You made it. Just look at you!” She clasps your hands, her smile warm and her grip firm. “I’m glad to finally have you here,” she says. Then she turns. “This is Kal Iver. I trained Kal last year—right before I started training you.” Kal Iver gives you a nod in greeting. “A pleasure,” he says."
campaign_guides.lure_of_the_valley.1_missions.narration_2,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/campaign_guides/lure_of_the_valley/missions,"Calypsa heads back to the station with you and Kal in tow. She speaks back over her shoulder. “Please, make yourselves at home. Explore the hanging gardens. Find Spirit Speaker Nal and Kordo, and strike up a conversation. Get to know the place.”
“After you’ve spent some time here at the Station, you should head over to White Sky,” she says. “In fact, Hy Pimpot has some juniper biscuits baking right now. His food is legendary around these parts. Once those biscuits are ready and you’ve had a chance to poke around, take a parcel over to White Sky, and offer them to the people you meet. It’s been at least a year since our neighbors have enjoyed the company of Rangers bearing treats.” She turns to look at Kal. “What do you think, Kal? Good way to get started?”
Kal grins at you in a way that you can’t quite describe as a sneer. “Handing out baked goods? I think that’s perfectly suited to their abilities,” he says."

On “-ness,” she punches Kal’s."

We’ll be on shadow patrol. That is, we’ll never be too far away from you for the next few weeks.”
“You shouldn’t need our help, of course,” Kal says. “I can tell by looking at you that you’re more than capable.”
“Farewell for now,” Calypsa says and starts down the eastern path away from Lone Tree. “Spirits guide you. Follow your instinct!” She and Kal walk steadily out of sight."

They always come bearing treats!” Hy Pimpot winks and takes a biscuit for himself.
You shoulder the basket and walk down the trail. As you do, the enticing aroma of the biscuits wafts up from the basket. You remember that you haven’t eaten anything since breakfast. Your stomach growls. Surely they won’t miss one or two."

Calypsa gestures toward the basket.
“How did it go?” she asks.
Before you can answer, Kal gives a mirthless laugh. “I think those crumbs speak for themselves.”
You glance down and self-consciously brush the biscuit crumbs off your shirt."

Calypsa gestures toward the basket.
“How did it go?” she asks.
You tell her of the people you met in your travels today and how each was appreciative of Hy Pimpot’s bakery.
Calypsa stands and makes a show of studying you closely. “And … no crumbs! I’m impressed. Kal, I believe this settles our bet. He figured you would have snuck a few for yourself.”
Kal looks at you suspiciously. “You need to learn to live a little,” he says."
campaign_guides.lure_of_the_valley.1_missions.1_03.narration_1,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/campaign_guides/lure_of_the_valley/missions/1_03,"From down the path comes the sound of melodic whistling. Before long, a man wearing many layers of cloaks and walking with the aid of an ornate conduit follows. As he passes, he tips his wide-brimmed hat in your direction.
“Good day to you, friends!”
“Good day, Master Aell,” Calypsa replies. “Lone Tree’s hanging gardens are thirsty. They’ll be grateful for some rain.”
“Fear not, my dear Calypsa! For there is no shaper more skilled at stirring the clouds than I. By the time you return, those gardens will be thoroughly soaked!”
With that, the shaper continues down the path. He resumes his whistling as he passes from sight.
Kal shakes his head. “That fool is overly impressed by his own abilities,” he says. “Trouble will come of it. Mark my words.”
Calypsa nods then turns to you. “It's time you should be on your way,"" she says. ""The village elders often have tasks that require the help of the Rangers. I recommend that you seek them out on your travels. I know also that Kordo would like some help dealing with the caustic mulcher that roams the woodlands. I'm not sure what he has in mind, but you can seek him out at Lone Tree Station if you're interested. Farewell!”
With that, Calypsa and Kal disappear into the forest, leaving you to explore the Valley on your own."
campaign_guides.lure_of_the_valley.1_missions.1_04.narration_1,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/campaign_guides/lure_of_the_valley/missions/1_04,"You wake up in the morning to a dark sky thick with clouds. Rain is falling on the head of the Valley in thick sheets, and the creek near your camp has spilled over its banks.
Before you finish packing, a familiar figure approaches your camp. It’s Kal Iver. “Make haste!” he calls. “Areas southeast of Lone Tree are flooding! It was that ridiculous shaper! Came to water the hanging gardens and instead created an entire storm front! Elder Thrush is sending teams across the upper Valley for rescue and relief efforts. You must go to White Sky, Kobo’s Market, and to the Golden Shore, if you can get there in time. Make sure everyone is safe, then provide whatever aid you can.”
“This could have been avoided,” Kal says, mostly to himself. He looks down the trail in the direction of Lone Tree, then back to you. “I would accompany you, but Calypsa and I have been tasked with finding Aell. Maybe he can fix the mess that he’s created and put a stop to this rain. You’re on your own. Good luck! You’re going to need it!”
As if on cue, a peal of thunder rattles the air."

 The wind has been rising steadily and now is blowing the rain in huge sheets across the lake. Swelling tributary streams threaten to overtake the shoreline. Animals and villagers alike flee to safety lest they be caught in the flood.
Kobo’s Market:
 From far off you can hear shouts of alarm. You can just make out the dell that holds Kobo’s Market through the driving rain. The water around the main structure is already knee deep, and you can see Ren Kobo’s porters saving what goods they can, retreating to the upper balcony.
Golden Shore:
 Tributary streams north of the shoreline have begun to spill their banks, becoming a boiling sluice of brown water among the pines. If the water isn’t redirected, it could wash out long stretches of the shoreline and carry away dozens, or even hundreds, of trees."

You decide to take a much needed nap, only to wake up to an impromptu party. A number of the locals have gathered with food and drink, and you end up spending most of the afternoon celebrating. Your revelry is interrupted when a man runs up to you and breathlessly says, “You need to come and see this!”"

Calypsa and Kal Iver are there as well, speaking quietly to one another. Among the debris, there is a startling sight: dozens of strange corpses, deposited here by the flood. The corpses are battered, broken, and caked in filth, but they are all clearly one species—a biomeld, and unlike anything any of you have ever seen. You see pale flesh, eyeless faces, and long limbs ending in claws.
Calypsa approaches you with a haunted look on her face. “Kal and I are going to help clean up this mess. What are they? And where did they come from?” She places her hand on your shoulder. “Bring word of this to Elder Orlin in Spire. If anyone in the Valley knows what these things are, it’s her.”"

You couldn’t shake the haunted look on Calypsa’s face when she saw those corpses, and ever since that day, you’ve felt a presence, like a patient predator lurking in the underbrush, hounding your every step."
campaign_guides.lure_of_the_valley.1_missions.1_08.narration_2,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/campaign_guides/lure_of_the_valley/missions/1_08,"As you cross the bridge to the center of town, Ben Amon, pilot of the Swift and master artificer, joins you. “Hello there! Elder Thrush asked that I come to Spire to check on the hydroelectric turbines just in case they suffered any damage during the flood,” he says. “What brings you here?”
You explain what brought you here, and his smile fades. Without delay, he accompanies you to see Elder Orlin.
You find Elder Mora Orlin in the heart of the Carbon Forge, bent over an air lathe with a heavy piece of carbon in her powerful hands. When she sees you, she shuts off the howling machine and straightens. “What is it?” she growls.
Her flinty stare never wavers as you describe the strange beings with the eyeless faces and dangerous looking claws. When you finish, she grunts and nods to you and Ben Amon. “My mother told me about these. When we first came over the passes into the Valley, our people encountered beings like the ones you described. Vicious biomelds. They called them ‘reclaimers.’”
You ask why “reclaimers?”
“I’m not certain,” says Elder Orlin. “But, they are biomelds—like the caustic mulcher and the toxin eater—and like all biomelds, they serve an ancient purpose. Perhaps they are compelled to capture something they perceive to be lost, or they search for some possession they believe to be theirs. The best way to discover the answer is to find them, and observe their behavior.""
“When you head out into the Valley, keep your eyes open. If you find reclaimers, see what you can learn about them.”
Ben Amon clears his throat. “Elder Orlin, searching the Valley could take weeks. If we want to know where they are, I can set up a scanning rig. We just need to place a few relays around the Valley, and I can sweep for these ... reclaimers.”
Elder Orlin shakes her head and gives Ben a bemused look. ”Sensors. Always sensors! We have all the sensors we need. Right here!” She taps her chest. “And here!” She taps her temple. “Use your instinct. Use your intellect. And you will find them.”
Ben doesn’t waver. “Elder, it’s a big valley. If we don't send some sort of help, they could hike within a half mile of a swarm of these things and never know it.” He turns to you. “What do you think? Do you want to spend weeks searching the Valley for these things, or discover exactly where they are in just a few days?”"
campaign_guides.lure_of_the_valley.1_missions.1_08.narration_3,https://thelivingvalley.earthbornegames.com/docs/campaign_guides/lure_of_the_valley/missions/1_08#rangers-choose,"You agree with Ben. The faster you find out if the reclaimers are in the Valley, the better. Elder Orlin grunts and turns back to her air lathe.
After you leave, Ben takes you to the Hearty Brew, the best tavern in the town. There you find his pincrawler parked in the courtyard. He opens the back hatch, revealing a store of parts and electronic components, along with a folding workbench. He sets to work crafting something, and when you ask what he’s doing, he distractedly mutters that you should think about getting some food.
By the time you’ve finished eating and return, you see a bundle of stakes about a meter long, each topped with a globe criss-crossed with complex circuit inlays. “These are relay scanners,” Ben explains proudly. “Set them up across the Valley, and they should generate a field that will pick up any biomeld activity. If there’s a swarm of reclaimers out there, we’ll see it. Just be sure to spread out the sensors as far as possible; opposite ends of the Valley would be best. When you stick them in the ground, just whistle this tune”— he blows three notes—“and the relay goes active.”
Ben hands you a glass disk in a smooth wooden frame. “Once all three are active, they will send the results to the biological outpost south of Branch. But you can see what they pick up with this.”"

""Nonsense! The tools we craft here at the Carbon Forge require real human effort. Our carbonforged blades, for example, have no equal in quality or durability, but they are nothing without the intention and skill of their wielder. A true artificer does not craft gadgets to replace the senses but creates tools to support and enhance them.""
""Well said, Elder Orlin. Well said. No matter how many years of experience I might accrue, I will forever be your apprentice."" Elder Orlin sets down her air lathe, gives Ben Amon a hug, and smiles at him. ""Not forever, Ben. Not forever."" She turns to you. ""Take care out there. Stay alert. And may the ancestors and your instincts guide you."""

Sirisana gets her up to speed on events, and the two immediately fall into a lively debate about what, if anything, to do about the reclaimers.
“They are clearly an invasive species,” Sirisana says. “There is no prior record of these biomelds in the Valley. Our ancestors encountered these reclaimers in the time before we settled here, but that was long ago. They're yet another biomeld run amok, fulfilling some esoteric purpose that's at odds with the natural world.”
“We don’t know that for certain,” Tiella retorts. “Even if they are fulfilling some outmoded purpose, they’ve had centuries to become part of the ecosystem! Look at the relgarbeasts! They were once viewed as an invasive pest, but over time we've learned how critical they are to the ecology of the Verdessa! Or take growling weevils—”

To learn more, you’re going to have to find it. Maybe you could tag the reclaimers and then follow the tagged ones back to their nest?”
You agree, and Tiella and Sirisana spend the next hour rigging up a simple tagging system; small, sticky balls of sap treated with a particularly pungent substance. Then they hand you a small cage full of wood shavings; in the center of which is a drowsy looking mole with a long pink muzzle.
“Becher’s mole,” Tiella explains. She reaches into the cage and pulls out the mole, who yawns sleepily. Then she wafts some of the pungent aroma under its nose, and the mole suddenly perks up and starts yipping shrilly. “One whiff of this mole sow musk, and Gus will follow it to the ends of the earth. He can smell it from up to two kilometers away!”
You leave with the mole and the sap tags, but only after making a promise that you’ll do your best to return Gus safe and sound once this is all over."

As you flee, you are unable to rid your mind of the indelible images—polyps growing from the secretions left by the reclaimers.
A safe distance away, you review your findings. The reclaimers seem to consume anything artificial—while the Estian ruins were severely damaged, no biological material seems to be affected by the corrosive secretions of the grubs. You’re starting to suspect they might be some sort of recycler organism given over to their singleminded purpose. From what you observed, the reclaimers reproduce asexually: the seekers find a suitable surface and secrete mucus that conjures polyps. Those polyps mature quickly into grubs which then grow into seekers. Left to their own devices, the reclaimers could easily overrun the Valley. A single reclaimer can spawn an entire population all on its own!
You realize in horror how important the Estian ruins are to the Valley. If the reclaimers fulfill their purpose, no village in the Valley will be safe, for each has repurposed what the Estians left behind to build homes, village centers, workshops, energy collectors, water systems—the list is endless. And Spire, the center of civilization in the Valley, would suffer the most, as it is built entirely upon the arcology ruin. At best, they might devour Spire and the ruins beneath. At worst … a sobering image of the entire Valley collapsing into the yawning darkness of a kilometers-wide sinkhole seeps into your mind.
Whatever happens, you need to speak with the Elders and your fellow Rangers. You gather yourself by taking several slow, measured breaths. Your heart rate steadies, and your mind clears. There is time yet to prevent disaster. Then you notice a familiar presence at the edge of your perception—Spirit Speaker Nal reaching out to you from across the Valley. You connect, as if sharing one mind.
You focus on the still-fresh images of the reclaimer nest and the implications of your discoveries. Nal acknowledges your message.
You suddenly see images of high grass waving in the wind, flocks of ironwool sheep, and a cleared space around the stump of a dolewood. You recognize it as the village of Meadow, and you understand that Nal wants you to go there as soon as you can. Then Nal’s presence fades and you’re alone once again.

“You've done well,"" she says. ""A group of seasoned veterans could hardly have done better. I believe your assessment is correct; we have to find some way to stop these reclaimers, or at least limit the destruction they might cause.”
Elder Abel shakes her head. “A bunch of ruin-eating biomelds that reproduce and spawn in a matter of hours? How are we supposed to stop that? Seems like we should be thinking of getting folks out of Spire as soon as we can and letting the reclaimers have it.”
You hear murmurs of agreement from the crowd. Kordo’s eyes flash angrily, but before he can speak, Thrush raises her hand. “Just because they are drawn to Spire now, does not mean they will remain there forever. Besides, even if we could evacuate the largest village in the Valley, none of us know just how far the arcology ruins extend underground. If the reclaimers consume too much, they could undermine the entire Valley.”

Ben Amon speaks up. “There is a skilled hunter who lives in Tumbledown. I hear this hunter regularly travels to the swamp to prune hydraworms—some of the most mindlessly violent biomelds in the Valley. Perhaps she could provide some insight.""
Elder Abel grunts. “No offense to the great hunters in our presence, but attacking the reclaimers sounds like a fools errand! If you'll recall, we were first made aware of these reclaimers thanks to a flood. Killed a score of them stone dead! Does anyone know where the shaper who caused that flood ran off to? Maybe he can do that again!” Calypsa steps forward. ""No, Elder Abel, but I've learned that his sister lives in Spire. She may know where he's gone.""

 As you walk among the villagers, you come across Elder Wellers of Tumbledown. ""I've heard you were with Kasende at the end,"" he says. ""Even though she spent most of her time away, we will miss her. Soon we will have a ceremony for her at the Grove. I hope to see you there.""

SPIRE FALLEN:
 Looking at the gathered crowd, you recognize many faces from Spire. Hopefully, Spire may be habitable again one day, but for now you suspect Branch and Meadow will absorb the greatest share of the displaced people.

Nal calls to her, speaking a language you don’t recognize. They speak for a few minutes, then Nal reaches into her tunic and pulls out a small bag, which she hands to the woman. In turn, the woman gives Nal a palm-sized glass disk with a strange plant suspended in its center.
After the woman leaves, Nal says, “I’m going to stay here awhile and speak with the spirit of this plant. It’s from the Verdessa, so it might help me overcome whatever is preventing the spirit of the Verdessa from coming through.”
“Actually,” she says. “I have a feeling this will work better if we do this together.” Nal takes your hand and gestures for you to sit across from her.

You’ve heard stories of the yeti before, but you thought they were just that: stories!
You look at the yeti for a long moment, and it looks back at you. Its eyes meet yours, and you feel oddly at peace, as if you and this yeti share an ancient kinship.
You begin to speak, and in response, it rumbles in a low, somehow nonthreatening, manner. Then it steps back, and slips behind a tree. You move to follow, but it’s no longer there. Something glints on the ground, however, right where the being had been standing."

Kordo quickly spots wisps of fur, small impressions in the ground, bent grass, and other signs of passage. He leads you on a rapid chase through the trees, pointing out each sign as he passes.
After a long five minutes of running through the forest, the yeti stops on the far side of a small clearing. Kordo stops next to you and holds out his hands. “Wait, wait. We mean you no harm.”
The yeti looks at you all for a moment, but especially at Kordo. Then, slowly and deliberately, it nods. It takes a small silver ovoid from somewhere and sets it on the loam. Then, without any fuss, it fades into nothingness and disappears. Kordo stands unmoving, a smile as wide as the Valley on his face and tears of joy in his eyes.
Later that day, Kordo finishes packing his bag. “I’m headed back to Lone Tree. Thank you for this. I won’t forget it.”
You clasp his shoulder and say farewell. He saunters down the trail, whistling a jaunty tune."

During your training, on clear, windless days, these platforms served as a refuge. You would often spend your free time in the afternoons bathing there in the sun, sitting in quiet contemplation and looking out over the mirrored surface of White Sky Lake. You'd also look wistfully at the airship known as the Swift, it's hull gleaming in the sun, as Ben Amon would climb aboard and launch it into the air.
The legs of the vehicle would compress and then extend with a sudden movement, propelling it upwards with tremendous force. Then, once it reached its apex, its wings would unfurl, and the glider would soundlessly soar toward the horizon, steadily descending as it flew toward its destination.
Calypsa told you and the other initiates that it was prone to roll and crash in inclement weather, and if you flew it any great distance, its energy cells would drain, and the Swift would grow inert, unable to launch for days before the cells recharged.
All this was clearly meant to dissuade you from taking the Swift out on your own, but when you look at the airship, you can’t help but feel a surge of excitement. To soar high above the Valley would surely be exhilarating, if not a little terrifying. Now that you're a full-fledged Ranger, perhaps you can convince the crew to take you for a ride."

Nal's gifts are greater still. For with the help of a device crafted by Ben Amon, she is able to communicate over great distances, projecting images and emotions into the minds of Rangers in the field.

“Don’t make it too dramatic,” Kordo grumbles. “I just think that if we’re going to be proper stewards here, it’s up to us to clean up our ancestor’s mistakes.”
“Biomelds aren’t mistakes!” Nal shoots back. “They may have been created for a purpose thousands of years ago, but in the time since they’ve evolved and become part of the ecosystem. They reproduce, they coexist, just like any other being.”
“Oh, you think that caustic mulcher that has been lumbering around the wooded areas of the Valley is coexisting with everything else?” Kordo looks at you. “Maybe you can settle this. Nal thinks that big sticky-tongued, acid-drooling eating machine is a part of the environment. I, on the other hand, think that it’s been eating its way through the rest of the ecosystem, and it’s time to stop it. What do you think?”

Kordo grunts. “You’ve already told me your plan to prove it. Coating yourself in leaf paste and seeing if the mulcher will eat you or spit you out? Sounds like a terrible idea.”

You gather around the pot, dipping your spoons into the fragrant broth. It is quite simply the best soup, and possibly the best food, you’ve ever had. The complex flavors blend perfectly, rich but not overpowering, fresh but hearty, warm and soothing yet light and effervescent. Your only regret, as you set down your spoon and realize the pot is empty, is that you may never taste something quite that good again.
Hy has a beatific smile on his face. “The best it’s ever been,” he says.
You all sit in contented silence for a while, before you get up the courage to ask Hy exactly how he made the soup. The master chef nods. “I’ll tell you the recipe,” he says. “As long as you promise to remember it, and practice it. Someday, I want you to serve me something even better than this!”"

“Welcome to the Bubble! Come over here, why don’t you?”
Silaro shows you the disk, which appears to be stamped with concentric rings of indecipherable text. He also shows you a translation device he’s built, a glass plate that, when laid over the text, slowly translates parts of it into something legible.
After a long time enthusiastically talking about his work, Silaro gets a thoughtful look in his eye. “You know, there are arcology ruins all over the Valley.

“These, I think, are quantumly entangled photons. I don’t know how they’re suspended in this medium, but the golden sparkles we see aren’t the photons themselves. I think they’re the photon’s quantum ‘ghosts.’”
He pulls out a pair of circular devices with faces of darkened glass. He flips them over to reveal a square slot. “Yes, the inscriptions I found said these needed to be powered by entangled photons, but I didn’t know what that meant until now.”
He plugs a cube into one of the devices. Slowly, long golden lines appear on the dark glass. Though the lines seem random, something about their movement tugs at your mind, like they‘re trying to tell you something.

You explain that you’re interested in the people who built this arcology, and Silaro gets a gleam in his eyes. “Ah, the Estians,” he says with a smile. “They’re a fascinating bunch, to be sure. I’ve been studying them my entire life, and I’ve only scratched the surface of what I can learn.”
“Tell you what,” he says. “The best way to learn is by doing, I always say. So why don’t you poke around the various ruins scattered through the Valley. If you find anything interesting, bring it back, and I’ll see what I can tell you about it. And I’ll share what I know of the Estians as well.”"

You crouch down next to him and see that he has been scraping away lichen from what appears to be sets of lines stamped all across the metal. “I think this is a map!” Silaro exclaims. “If I’m right, this arcology goes much deeper than any of us assumed. It’s spread out much further too! All through the Valley, and maybe even out into the Verdessa!”
You tell Silaro about your own investigations, and he excitedly compares your notes to his map. “Indeed, indeed!” he shouts. “Thanks to your observations, I think I can orient myself to this map. It appears you’re right … the arcology does reach out to the Verdessa. See this route here? It reaches all the way out into that huge forest. There must be something there … too bad the route is far deeper than we’ve ever traveled in these ruins.”
He thinks for a long moment. “But what makes me even more curious is the evidence that they were gone long before the floods. I always assumed the floods wiped them out, but if they were already gone, then…well, clearly the dam failed because of their long absence, so they must have left decades or even centuries before. “I can tell you one thing, though. They didn’t travel overland; there’s no evidence of them leaving through the northern passes. Honestly, there’s no evidence that they migrated from this place at all. So … what happened to them?”"

“After he flooded the Valley, you want him to flood the Valley again? He was pretty distraught the first time. I don't think he'll be up for it.""
You tell her that Aell is the best hope the Valley has and that it would be a mistake not to at least try to convince him to help.
After a moment, she agrees. ""You're right. I know you're right. I can be misled by my feelings about my brother. I wouldn't be able to convince him to cause another flood, but you might.

You see the brief flash of an otherwise invisible suspensor field, and the shards join the larger cloud. Tollin thinks for a moment, then uses a pole to nudge and push the material into a new form. You’ve heard of kinetic glass before, but this is the first time you’ve seen it used in such a quantity.

Even as you watch, the shape slowly moves their arms, and the stones solidify into a sparkling obsidian obelisk that envelops the figure, before breaking apart and returning to its swirling spiral.
Tollin watches with a satisfied smile. “The hardest kinetic glass work I’ve ever attempted,” he says. “And thanks to you, it was a success.”
He reaches into his bag and pulls out a hemisphere roughly the size of his palm, along with a large leather pouch. “Here,” he hands it to you. “I’m afraid I don’t have anything more practical to give you in return, but this is a sculpture I did of a rabbit when I was practicing my realism.

Anyway, I’ve created the design, but now I have to haul nearly one hundred kilos of kinetic glass and materials there.” He looks faintly abashed. “I … may have gotten carried away.”
Suddenly he brightens. “Hey, you travel all over the Valley, right? Could you help me take the sculpture to Stoneweaver Bridge? I bet it would be really easy if we had a boat; maybe one of the ones Lyn Mira makes out in Branch? But we could just carry the materials there too.”"

Unable to resist the temptation, you put your lips to it and blow. A deep, melodious rumble resonates from its mouth, vibrating your bones and causing the birds to erupt from the forest all around you in a raucous, protesting chorus.

""You could also find Kasende here in Tumbledown and speak with her. I know she's been tracking the reclaimers herself. She was working with the local artificers on something related. I'm not sure what."""

You stand on the edge of a large pit, where it looks like an entire grove of trees has collapsed into the ground not long ago.

The sinkhole may have exposed a new route into the old arcology beneath the Valley."

Twenty minutes later, you find a workshop. The machinery has been carefully powered down, and you are able to activate a small autolathe. After using it to sculpt several useful items out of the nearby bricks of omni-resin, you turn it off again. The only other items of interest are a set of small glass bricks tucked into a corner.

It turns out that the archway leads to a maze of passageways. You explore a little way in but worry about getting lost. The worn print carved into the walls is in a language utterly alien to you and is useless for navigation. Even so, you find a storage locker a few dozen meters down that still has some portable power cells. Their construction is marvelous even after thousands of years, you can still use them to charge your gear.

When we move through it, we cannot help but affect it.” She takes a few steps then gestures behind her to the grass crushed beneath her boots. “That’s why we should think before we act. It can often be better to observe and otherwise avoid the living things in the Valley. And when we can’t observe … ”

Tykor himself is sitting cross-legged on a large boulder with what appears to be an offering of fruits, flowers, and fragrant tea set out before him. His eyes are closed, and you can hear him mumbling to himself.

Tykor strokes his grizzled chin and stares into space for a while. “That’s a good question,” he says finally. “On the one hand, these reclaimers of yours are clearly biomelds, created by our ancestors for Guide knows what reason. You could argue that removing them is no different than disassembling one of your villages so that everyone can live a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. In fact, you could even argue that removing them is just cleaning up our ancestors’ mess.”
“But,” he continues, raising a finger, “Humans have been a part of the ecosystem for hundreds of thousands of years. This whole ecosystem,” he gestures to the Valley and the world beyond with wild sweeps of his hands, ""is created by humans. First we changed it with our actions thousands of years ago, then we changed it again with the Generational Projects trying to change the first change!”
He laughs for a moment, then grows serious. “Perhaps the only thing we can do is to resolve to step back from this point forward, and stop meddling. That’s what I’d suggest, at any rate. Stop meddling, because it always leads to more meddling.” But then you hear his voice quiver just a tiny bit. “But … I suppose that’s a cold comfort to all the people those reclaimers might hurt.

He thinks for another moment, then abruptly speaks. “I guess it’s because of how I live,” he says. “I don’t see us having any right to build houses and lay down roads across this Valley. That’s just us imposing our will on the rest of the world, which we have no more right to do than any other animal.”
You ask if human’s sapience changes the situation at all, and he waves his hands as if driving off a fly. “You sound like all the rest. No, no, our sapience just means we should recognize our capacity to change the world, and then make the conscious choice to reject that.”

When you raise a hand in greeting and ask what’s wrong, the woman gestures back along the trail.
“A horde of those reclaimers,"" she explains breathlessly. ""They’ve been spotted heading straight for Spire! We left as soon as we could.”
You thank them and let them hurry on their way. If Spire is going to be attacked, then the village will need all the help that it can get. If you intend to help, you'd better get going."

You take a deep breath, splash water on your face, and remind yourself that the danger has passed. All the same, you feel the need to be a bit more alert than usual today."

It's Kal Iver. His cloak is torn, and he's covered in either dirt or soot.
""Wake up,"" he says. ""I thought you might be dead, but here you are, sleeping peacefully while the village of Spire was destroyed and thousands of people were displaced. We could have used your help, you know. I hope whatever you were busy doing was of equal importance.""
He looks with dismay at a rend in his cloak. ""You must travel to Lone Tree Station. Elder Thrush wants all Rangers to check in as soon as they are able."" With that, Kal departs."

You do the only thing you can do; making him as comfortable as possible, you light a signal fire and then spread out, looking for the tallest point to try and signal a rescuer.
That evening, a traveling merchant on a pincrawler spots your signal. You set Lunn on the back of the crawler, and the merchant waves farewell as they head toward the nearest Ranger station."

Luckily, that evening you see the Swift soaring through the sky to your position.

You remember stopping before a tree which began to grow before your very eyes, stretching toward the sky like you were observing centuries of growth in the span of a few minutes. As the tree grew wider and wider, you felt the sudden need to escape, but when you tried, you found that you could not move. You looked down to see that your feet had taken root. You were no longer human, but a Verdessian. Just before the tree consumed you, you awoke.
You spend a moment contemplating your experience. You consider the possibility it wasn't a dream at all, but instead a message from the Verdessian. If it is, you're not sure how to interpret it. Regardless, you suddenly feel very awake and very alert."

 After hours of bailing water and reassembling stalls, the market row is clearing up. It will take a while for everything to dry out, but trade has returned to Kobo's market.
