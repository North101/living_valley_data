He waves as you approach.
""Any luck gathering those flowers?"" he asks. You nod and carefully arrange them onto a nearby table.
""These flowers are in excellent condition,"" Etra says, admiring your work. ""You have a delicate touch. Thank you!""He beams with delight.""Now to make the decorations!""
You weren't planning on spending the rest of the day making festival decorations, but such is the life of a Ranger. You begin to unfasten your pack when Etra stops you.
""I can ask no more of you, my friend,"" he says. ""We have more than enough hands to arrange these flowers!""
You share a laugh and say your goodbyes, counting the days until the festival begins."

Calypsa,
I'm writing to inform you of something that took place while Tiella and I were traveling east from the Biological Outpost. We took our usual route, making note of the Terravore's position and marking its progress, but while we were there, a rumbling from deep underground stopped us in our tracks. Normally I wouldn't be rattled by such an event—we've all felt tremors from time to time. But this gave me pause because I could swear it was coming from the Terravore itself, or perhaps just beneath it.
Might you be able to convince Elder Thrush to send a patrol into the Terravore to discern the cause? I would ask her myself, but I think that I may have lost some sway with her after the infamous bearsloth debacle, and an excursion into the mouth of the Terravore would be far more dangerous to say the least.

A hoversled overstuffed with crates and barrels hums to life as you approach, lifting a quarter of a meter into the air.
""It's good to see you again!"" he says. ""You must be my Ranger escort."" He shakes your hand again, his grip firm. ""I've got all the supplies loaded and ready to go. Normally I wouldn't need the help, but something's got the cloudhive bees in a stir, and I don't want to take any chances. In any event, it should be a short journey to Brookside.

When it doesn't respond, he gives it a firm kick. It sputters a few times, lifts a couple centimeters off the ground, then collapses once more.
""It's broken, all right,"" Raemon says with a sigh. ""Could be the matter harmonizers, or even the molecular phase buffers. Regardless, we'll need to get some stilt-horses out here and tow it back to the artisan's workshop in White Sky for repairs."""

You follow her gaze, and eventually spot several iridescent blue bees flitting about the tables where the festival supplies are set up.
Now that you think about it, you've been seeing quite a few cloudhive bees around, far more than usual. You ask Tiella if she's concerned about the presence of so many bees, and she nods absently.
""It's rare for cloudhives to be out this far from the shade of the old forests, but this out-of-season bloom has them on the move."" Tiella looks on thoughtfully. ""The cloudhive's behavior is predictable, but the circumstances of the bloom are undeniably strange.""
After a moment, she continues. ""Let's get to the bottom of it, shall we? I have a strong suspicion that the truth lies within the blooms themselves."" She reaches into her pack and produces a small device—like a glass vial, with a stem and a brush-like tip extending from its center.
""This is a pollen brush,"" she says. ""If you can collect some pollen for me, I can study it. Just dip this brush into an open flower and the pollen will be sucked into the vial. I'll be here in Brookside, cataloguing the bees' flight patterns and observing their behavior. What do you think?"""

A strange, translucent-brown sludge has accumulated at the bottom of the vial, which she examines closely. ""Well done,"" she says. ""I think you may have found the cause of this unseasonal bloom.""
You wait patiently as she scrapes the viscous liquid from the vial into a small dish, then dons a custom pair of hydrolens goggles set to maximum magnification. The sun travels far across the sky as she studies the contents of the dish, occasionally making notes in her journal. Finally, she takes off the goggles and invites you to look for yourself.
""I have a working theory,"" she says as the sample comes into microscopic view. ""The liquid appears to the naked eye to be biological, but it's not. Do you see those subtle modifications in its cellular structure? I suspect that it's something the Estians concocted centuries ago to accelerate plant growth, and that it was somehow released into the environment once more. That would explain the bloom. There's a decent chance that the cloudhive bees themselves caused the spread of this compound, and now they're reaping the rewards. When the weather turns, and the cold rain comes, the bees will retreat to the warmth of their cloudhives and things should return to normal around here. Until then, we'll need to be wary of cloudhives appearing where they normally would not.""
She hands you a glass cylinder with a spray nozzle. Inside, the thick brown liquid glimmers in the sunlight.
""Yet another gift from the Estians,"" she says.""I don't know about you, but I can't wait to experiment with this stuff. Scientifically, of course."""

You become hungry in an instant, as if you hadn't eaten in days.
The sound of conversation, laughter, and music fills the air. Children squeal with joy and waves of hearty cheers rise and fall.
If FESTIVAL SUPPLIES GATHERED:
 The festival grounds have been completely transformed since last you were here. What stands before you is a gathering on a scale of which you have rarely witnessed. It seems as though every last one of Spire's thousands of inhabitants have gathered upon Brookside's festival grounds. Many of them wear decorative floral necklaces, bracelets and anklets, bringing a splash of vivid color to their outfits."

One lands on the rim of your carbonforged cup and very nearly takes a swim in your sunberry wine. You set down your cup and start patrolling the grounds.
The bees are everywhere, mostly dancing in the air a few meters above the heads of festival-goers, but you notice more than one person swatting at the air or ducking for cover.
You spot Etra on his way to the front of the main tent, presumably to announce the start of the feast. Just then you hear a droning buzz in the distance, and a looming shadow begins to crawl over the festival grounds.
The sound grows and grows until it rises above even the clamor of the festival. A few people excitedly point to the sky, yelling in surprise. Your gaze snaps upward and it takes you a moment to comprehend what you're seeing.
What you first took for a small, dark cloud is actually the underside of a massive cloudhive, its bees gathered in ritualistic flight, holding it aloft, moving it steadily across the sky.
Someone yells in alarm, and the crowds scatter as a wide tornado of bees descends upon the festival grounds. Swarms terrorize the thoroughfares, gathering on the floral decorations, and on the food and drink, much of it still in the hands of fleeing villagers.
You call out to everyone to shed their floral jewelry, but it's not enough to stop the chaos. There's not a doubt in your mind; you have to find a way to get these bees out of here before they ruin the entire festival!"

A great cheer rises up from the scattered crowd. The festival is saved."

As the sound persists, you get the impression that the bees of the cloudhive are in something of a discussion. Then, as if called to action, the bees infesting the grounds take to the sky and begin to gather around the hive.
Soon the hive becomes nearly invisible behind dark clouds of swarming bees. The sound of buzzing builds to a crescendo as the cloudhive raises high into the air, and eventually becomes all but lost in the clouds.

Dear Olyv,
I know it's been a while, and a letter from me is probably the last thing you expected or even wanted to receive, but I have to say something. I have to make amends in whatever way I can.
I was so angry and hurt when you decided to leave. It felt like you were abandoning me, but I know now that you were just following your heart, like the Elders teach us to. It wasn't right of me to get so mad, or to say the things that I said…that wasn't right, either.
The truth is, I've been a coward. I could have written you before. I could have even traveled to Lone Tree. I chose not to. I chose to stay here on my boat, wallowing in my misery. But I want you to know that I've finally come to my senses, and I have the pendant you gave me when we were kids to prove it.
As you can see, I found it. That night when we fought—when I off and threw it into the Silverfin—I wasn't myself, but then I saw the look on your face. I'll never forget it. You looked so devastated—like there was nothing worse that I could have done—and then you were gone. I felt like my heart had been ripped out. I thought about jumping in after it, but I knew that it had already been washed away by the current. So I just stood there and watched you go.
But then a couple days ago, what do I spot propped up in an artisan's stall like he made it himself? Your pendant. I couldn't believe it. I asked him where he found it, and he said it was at the bottom of a bundle of river stones he aquired from a merchant in Brookside. I had to trade half my stock of seasoned sitka jerky to get it back, but it was more than worth it.
I am so sorry, Olyv. I hope you can forgive me. I'll understand if you never want to speak to me again, but if there's any part of you that does, I hope you'll listen to that part, and come to see me while you're out on patrol. I'm at the docks most days, if I'm not out on the river. Or, if you send word, I'll happily make the journey to Lone Tree Station.

It was a sobering experience for everyone involved, and a not-so-subtle reminder that the life of a Ranger is often perilous.
Because of her injury, Olyv needed to spend many moons in recovery, and fell behind in her training as a result. It does your heart good to see her up and about again. She cautiously hops down as you approach.
""Hey! How's your patrol going?"" she asks. ""Must be nice to finally be done with your training, huh?"" Her voice is tinged with a bit of envy."

You tell Olyv that you're sorry to hear that she's having trouble, but that she shouldn't give up. It's surely only a matter of time before she's ready to get back out there.

Hummingbirds and cloudhive bees flit here and there among them. You can't remember seeing so many flowers in one place in your entire life.
""A glorious morning, is it not?"" You're stirred from your reverie by a man's voice calling from the trail. You recognize Raemon from your travels—he often runs caravans of both supplies and people to and from Spire. He approaches your camp and shakes your hand in greeting. 
""It's always a pleasure to meet a Ranger on the trail. Looks like the weather is going to be perfect for the Blossom Festival, doesn't it? What good fortune!""
This is the first you've heard of a ""Blossom Festival,"" but you're not surprised by the news.

It is strange, you think to yourself, to see so many plants flowering at once—and so many out of season. You wonder aloud at the cause.
Raemon laughs. ""I have responsibilites enough without troubling myself with such questions,"" he says. ""But if you want to unravel the mysteries of nature, I wish you luck on your quest. May the ancestors guide you!"" 
With that, Raemon waves goodbye and returns to the trail. You see him join up with a caravan of hoversleds and stilt-horse wagons traveling in the direction of White Sky.
As you prepare for the day ahead, you imagine the delights that the Blossom Festival might hold—honeyed sunberry wine, the luxurious sounds of a dolewood lute, specially prepared foods and confections created by Spire's most talented chefs…
…perhaps you should go to the festival grounds of Brookside, the small village on the riverbank across from Spire itself, to see how preparations for the festival are coming along. Rangers are tasked with aiding the people of the Valley in whatever way they can, after all. Maybe they could use a hand.
